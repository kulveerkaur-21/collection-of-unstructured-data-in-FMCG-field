The tool that is given the priority over others in  identifying the waste is Value stream mapping. Value stream mapping is a lean tool that is used to translate both  information and flow of data through which those processes that are not adding any positive value in our study can be  easily eliminated. This paper is an effective effort to find out the waste production during manufacturing of a perishable  goods in discrete manufacturing system. Pareto chart has been used to categories the factors that are responsible for the  80 percent of waste. Here Ishikawa diagram has played a vital role for finding of their possible causes and effect. Other  contemporary lean tools like Kanban, Kaizen, and FIFO are used for future state map processing. The result obtained  through the future state value stream map states the changeover time of various processes, the cycle time near to the takt  time, improvement in lead time and total cycle time of the manufacturing process.

I hope to be able to cover a bit of  theory and all the major collectors in the hotspot virtual machine over the course of the series. This post  just explains what garbage collection is and elements common to different collectors.    Why should | care?    Your Java virtual machine manages memory for you ~ which is highly convenient — but it might not be  optimally tuned by default. By understanding some of the theory behind garbage collection you can more  easily tune your collector. A common concem is collector efficiency, that is to say how much time your  program spends executing program code rather than collecting garbage. Another common concern is long  that application pauses for.    There’s also a lot of hearsay and folklore out there about garbage collection and so understanding the  algorithms in a bit more detail really helps avoid falling into common pitfalls and traps. Besides — for  anyone interested in how computer science principles are applied and used, JVM internals are a great  thing to look at.    What does stop-the-world mean?    Your program (or mutator in GC-Speak) will be allocating objects as it runs. At some point your heap  needs to be collected and all of the collectors in hotspot pause your application. The term ‘stop-the-  world’ is used to mean that all of the mutator’s threads are paused.    Its possible to implement a garbage collector that doesn’t need to pause. Azul have implemented an  effectively pauseless collector in their Zing virtual machine. I won’t be covering how it works but there’s,  a really interesting whitepaper if you want to know more,    The Young/Weak Generational Hypothesis    Simply stated: Most allocated objects die young '. This concept was demonstrated by empirically  analysing the memory allocation and liveness patterns of a large group of programs during the 1980s,  What researchers found was that not only do most objects die young but once they live past a certain age  they tend to live for a long time. The graph below is taken from a SUN/Oracle study looking at the  lifespan of objects as a histogram.         Mer colecnont ger olecsons    Pye maviing    Bytes allocated    How is Heap organised?    ‘The young generational hypothesis has given rise to the idea of generational garbage collection in which  heap is split up into several regions, and the placement of objects within each region corresponds to their  age. One element that is common to the above these garbage collectors (other than G1) is the way that  heap is organised into different spaces.       SUSTAINABLE CLEAN TECHNOLOGY™    "

On the one hand, some products are disposed of for various reasons, and on the other, waste is generated through packaging. FMCG companies have been producing an increasing amount of waste and single-use plastic. Companies need to be more mindful of the waste generated throughout their value chain. Companies like Procter & Gamble and Dabur India recently claimed that they have achieved 'plastic waste neutrality’ by recycling a big chunk of their post-consumer plastic packaging waste. They have come under pressure to manage waste in order to be environmentally friendly and raise consumer awareness. Companies that are environmentally conscious are better able to draw in new clients since customers like to work with businesses that share their values. Waste Generation of Major FMCG Companies In 2021, Heineken, Nestle, Essity, Tyson Foods, and Asahi Group were the major FMCG companies which generated significant waste. Heineken NV (Heineken) is a brewing company that develops, markets, and sells alcoholic beverages. In total, Heineken generated 4,493 thousand tonnes of waste in 2021, an increase of 6% from 2020. In the same year, Heineken reused\xa021.31 thousand\xa0tonnes of waste and disposed of 62.64 thousand\xa0tonnes of waste in landfills. The company\xa0has set a target to send zero waste to landfill across all its production sites worldwide by 2025. Nestle SA (Nestle) is a manufacturer and marketer of food products and beverages. The total waste generated by Nestle in 2021 was\xa01,568 thousand\xa0tonnes\xa0of which 99% of the waste was non-hazardous. The company has set a goal to make 100% of its packaging recyclable or reusable and reduce the use of virgin plastics by one-third by 2025. Essity AB\xa0(Essity), formerly Essity Aktiebolag, is a manufacturer, producer, and seller of consumer tissue, personal care, and professional hygiene products. The waste generated by Essity AB in 2021 was\xa01,448 thousand tonnes\xa0which decreased by 3% over 2020. The company disposed of 516 thousand tonnes of waste of which 507 thousand tonnes of waste were disposed to landfills. It\xa0aims to reduce landfill disposals and other disposals by 100% by 2030 to achieve zero production waste. Tyson Foods Inc (Tyson Foods) is a food processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork. In total, Tyson Foods generated 1,337 thousand tonnes of waste in 2021,\xa0a decline of 55% from 2020. Around 85% of the company' total waste generation in 2021 was recycled. In the same year, Tyson Foods\xa0dumped 200 thousand tonnes of waste in landfills in the same year. Asahi Group Holdings Ltd (Asahi Group) manufactures, markets, and sells alcoholic beverages, soft drinks, and food products. In 2021, Asahi Group generated 1,030 thousand tonnes of waste\xa0which decreased by 10% over 2020. The company recycled 100% of its waste generated during the year.\xa0It has set a target to achieve zero landfill waste at manufacturing bases by 2030. "
2,Webscrapping-2,"IntroductionThe Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry is the 4th largest in the Indian Economy. By its nature, the industry includes goods that are produced, marketed, sold, and consumed rapidly – cycle time being at its minimum.Thus, also arises the need to package it not only with utmost safety but also at the lowest possible manufacturing cost due to the large manufacturing volume. How can stringent measures of plastic neutrality among the companies operating in the FMCG industry can help save the planet? Let us take a look at some facts and figures.How do the World and India Fare with Plastic Waste and Pollution?The World Plastic PollutionIn the last 50 years, world plastic production has increased 200 times from around 2 MT/year to about 400 MT/year today. And it has been steadily growing at an alarming rate of 15 MT/year.While the usage of plastic has been growing over the years, efforts are being made to find ways to recycle waste. The result, however, is not too encouraging. Below are the statistics by Geyser (for the year 2010)\xa0 –Plastic Produced in the world – 381 MTRecycled – 74 MT (19%)Burned – 97 MT (25%)Discarded – 210 MT (56%)India at a Glance – Plastic PollutionSome startling “plastic” facts about IndiaIndia is one of the few countries in the world that generates less than 100 gms of plastic per person per day. (Germany, Guyana, Ireland, Kuwait, USA, New Zealand generate more than 300 gms of plastic per person per dayIndia ranks 15th in the world for total plastic waste generated in a year85% of the plastic waste generated in India is litteredIndia ranks 5th in the world (just behind China, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Indonesia) among the highest plastic litterers of the globe amounting to 2% of the world’s total mismanaged plastic waste \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0While the per capita consumption of plastic in India is low, the amount of plastic waste generated is huge and largely remains untreated.A quick look at the industry statistics reveals that the Packaging industry produces the maximum amount of waste \xa0–Plastic Production by IndustryFMCG industry is the biggest contributor to the packaging plastic waste generated. Statistics reveal that – In 2014, >95% of the total number of biscuits, dried processed food items, and hair care products; and >85% of dairy products, baked goods, laundry, and skincare sold in India were packaged in plastic.According to the government reports –India generates 10 MT per year of plastic waste from the FMCG sectorIndia’s recycling rate is now at 60% against the global average of 20%While these statistics do not align with that of some independent research reports, the bottom line remains that with the growing usage of plastic, it is time that the FMCG companies start putting up efforts to help India achieve its goal to become plastic neutral by 2022.Stepping Stone – Being Plastic NeutralBefore the Prime Minister’s speech on October 2nd, 2019 about eliminating the usage of single-use plastic, more than 20 FMCG companies pledged to become plastic neutral by 2022. This included FMCG companies like Hindustan Unilever, Dabur, ITC, Kelloggs, Mother Dairy, Nestle, Modelez, Pepsico India, Bisleri, Coca-Cola India, among others.Below are some of the statements by some of the leading players in the FMCG industry.Leaders of FMCG Companies on Plastic Waste ProblemRecently, Nestle announced that two of its biggest brands – Maggi Noodles and Kitkat – to go plastic neutral by Dec 2019. Reporting doubt digit profits in the last quarter, this commitment from Nestle comes as a welcome change effective within a span of just 2 months.ChallengesWhile efforts are being made to eliminate the use of plastic in the FMCG industry, there is a need to find innovative solutions in the packaging industry. The current usage of plastic is one of the cheapest and effective ways to help reduce commodity prices thereby helping the masses esp in the rural areas.With growing concerns on the environment and a subsequent upcoming ban on plastic usage completely, it needs to be seen how will the companies operating in the packaging sector help curtail prices by using alternative means of packaging. Questions have also been raised on the livelihood of people working in this sector.While there are many questions to answer and a long way ahead, one thing remains clear – environmental consciousness has reached the right person and we will definitely come up with innovative solutions in the near future to address questions pertaining to an alternative packaging material that is cost-effective.Solution IdeasSome of the ideas which the FMCG companies can incorporate as part of their action plan, which we have written in another post as well.Reducing the reliance on sachets bags and single-use plastic packaging.Investing in alternative delivery systems\xa0 – like using biodegradable materials, or home refill serviceLarge companies also need to collaborate with startups and small companies that are working on creating sustainable packaging. Most times the niche company will come up with a better solution than the R&D wing of a big corporate.Introduce non-plastic-based packaging, probably paper, glass, or metal-based wherever applicable.Reduce virgin plastic (new plastic made from oil) packaging and instead use recycled materials\xa0In a world where only 14% of the plastic packaging makes its way to recycling plants, it becomes pertinent for companies to encourage consumers to return the plastic after use – such that effective waste disposal can happen.

3,Webscrapping-3,"Jakarta, Indonesia – Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) corporations are a predominant force behind the throwaway economic model driving the plastic pollution crisis, according to a comprehensive sector survey Greenpeace International released today. None of the companies surveyed have plans to put the brakes on the growing production and marketing of single-use plastics, while the solutions they are exploring will only perpetuate the problem. “We hoped to identify industry leaders through this process, but instead found that the whole sector has failed to take responsibility for the plastic pollution crisis and is instead trying to maintain the status quo,” said Ahmad Ashov, Global Plastics Project Leader, Greenpeace Indonesia. “There is a lack of transparency and all current public commitments by these companies allow for an increased use of single-use plastic in the future. That needs to change.”  “Their current business model is based on the assumption that ultimately all plastic packaging can, and will, be collected and recycled into new packaging or products.”  The four companies that reported the highest sales of single-use plastic products (Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestlé and Danone) were also the top four brands identified in a recent global Break Free From Plastic brand audit report following 239 plastic pollution cleanups in 42 countries. Greenpeace’s report, “A Crisis of Convenience: The corporations behind the plastics pollution pandemic”, focuses on 11 of the biggest FMCG companies: Coca-Cola Company, Colgate-Palmolive, Danone, Johnson and Johnson, Kraft Heinz, Mars, Nestlé, Mondelez, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Unilever.  Key findings:  Single-use packaging is the main delivery system used by all of the FMCG companies, with no signs of changing. None of the surveyed FMCG companies have comprehensive strategies that include commitments to move away from single-use plastic.  Most FMCG companies are actually increasing the amount of single-use plastic packaging and waste they produce. Most FMCG companies know or disclose little about the amount of their packaging that is recycled and even less about the destination of their plastic waste after consumption. Despite their significant plastic footprint, solutions being explored by businesses are primarily related to addressing recyclability or recycling, not reducing or creating new delivery systems. There is a lack of transparency in the sector and few FMCG companies are willing to disclose important data about their plastic use.  The survey looked to determine the degree to which FMCG commitments, actions and performance are addressing the environmental and social impacts of their plastic packaging and waste.  “The sector urgently needs to change its business model and prepare for a world where disposable products and packaging are no longer acceptable,” said Ashov. The FMCG sector represents one of the largest industries worldwide. Most FMCG companies are growing at rates between 1 – 6% each year.[1] If current trends continue, their use of single-use plastic will increase in parallel.

4,Webscrapping-4," The Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry regularly produces monumental waste. Today sustainability is the central issue of every society. Today, the average consumer is more aware of their product choices’ environmental impact than a consumer as little as five years ago. The change is real and apparent and can no longer be ignored. With the increase in awareness about sustainability and its significance and the rise in eco- friendly regulations, sustainable packaging is, now more than ever, an issue of concern for customers. With this tectonic shift in consumer behaviour towards more sustainable and eco-friendly products, it is time for the FMCG industry to make some strategic changes. Brands have already started adopting sustainable marketing based on this shift in consumer mindset. However, we believe it Optimizing environmental andbefore purchasing. What drives the purchase? What deters it? These are economic impacts in supply chains ...essential questions to understand the consumer and build brands genuinely. sysiainable Production and Consumption, Vo We may already know what factors affect the consumer decision-making MAH. van Elzakker, cycle, but understanding the root cause behind those factors is of utmost importance. This research aims to analyze consumer perception and behaviour regarding eco-friendly and sustainable packaging. For this research, we have thoroughly reviewed thirty research papers to gain insights into all the study that has already been conducted. We also worked on both moderated and unmoderated focus group discussions to better understand Citations. consumer behaviour towards sustainability. We have derived a fair idea of the gap between consumer understanding, behavior, and products available in the market. We get various insights from the definition of sustainability, factors influencing consumers, and why current trends and practices, and even practices in other industries (other than FMCG) would be a beneficial correlation/comparison aspect.The climate around us is changing faster now than ever, and for the worse.The temperature is rising; ice caps are melting, animals are extinct, and more. Amidst all this, our daily waste is soaring higher and higher. The amount of non-biodegradable items we use daily is astonishing. We are currentlyrunning out of space to dump our trash. And as such, FMCG has a significantrole in our consumption of plastics and other non-biodegradable items. WithGen-Z entering the workforce and gaining more and more buying power, it iscrucial to make strategic organizational changes. Not only to attract them ascustomers but also as potential employees of a socially-aware organization.Today sustainability is the central issue of every society. With the increase inawareness about sustainability and its significance and the rise in eco- friendly regulations, sustainable packaging is, now more than ever, an issue ofconcern for customers. Sustainability is frequently analysed using the TripleBottom Line (TBL) (Eilert, 2005) approach based entirely on economic, social, and environmental impacts. In each of these three dimensions, packaging plays a critical role.  Economical - It can alleviate the direct and indirect cost of operation through the change in material, optimum handling of goods, speedy transportation, and efficient warehousing.  Social - It can reduce and recover waste from food by enforcing product protection and ensuring the safety of workers through more effective ergonomic designs.  Environmental - It can reduce the carbon footprint generated by ensuring optimal use of the packaging materials and designs used over the lifespan of a commodity.  As of late, ideas of dynamic packaging, astute packaging, and biodegradable/palatable packaging have been created and effectively applied in FMCGs to improve the correspondence, upgrade the quality and well-being of products, delay its period usability, give a sign about healthiness and control its newness. Upgrading the actual usability lifespan of the products includes disposal of different microbial, biochemical and enzymatic responses by receiving other systems of temperature control, dampness guidelines, expansion of synthetics, and execution of a viable packaging framework. The change from orthodox packaging models to new and innovative methodologies is because of the promising attributes of ongoing practices, such as manageability and compatibility of biodegradable materials, observing and following the capacity of savvy and intelligent packaging, and efficient execution of dynamic packaging. Significant driving forces behind the rise of advancements in the packaging industry are improvement of negligibly handled nourishments, stringent laws concerning security, what's more, nature of the product, present-day appropriation practices, for example, web-based shopping, worldwide retail drifts, contamination related problems with the efficient use of petro-chemical polymer materials and the ever-rising interest of imparting bundles demonstrating harm and remaining timeframe of realistic usability of the item (Singhal and Malik, 2018). These impending steps in the packaging industry will fortify the economy due to a better timeframe of realistic usability and a decrease in the misfortunes of the items (Vila-Lopez and Kiister-Boluda, 2020). Consumers today are more aware of the harmful effects of single-use packaging material on the environment and are actively choosing sustainable packaging. However, many customers find the increased price of sustainably packed goods to hinder and discourage them.  The purpose of conducting this study is to analyse trends in the FMCG Industry regarding sustainable packaging from a marketing point of view and how it affects consumer perception and the brand's position. Also, to look  into viable technologies and innovations for sustainable packaging. We  believe it is beneficial to understand consumers’ various factors before purchasing. What drives the purchase, and what deters it? These are important questions to understand consumers and build brands around them genuinely. We may already know what factors affect the consumer decision- making cycle, but understanding the root cause behind those factors is of utmost importance.  Gen-Z has been extremely vocal and upfront about its concerns for the environment and climate around us. Organizations must follow Gen-Z entering the workforce and enjoying buying and decision-making power. Most of the trends we see today are led and driven by this group. Hence we have chosen to keep them as our focal point. We can notice a visible change, with brands moving towards more sustainability-centric messaging in their communication, Everyone is looking for sustainable options for all firms, from age-old conglomerates to budding start-ups. It is no surprise that this comes with the constant and ever-increasing awareness and concern about the environment in the young generation. The paper aims to target corporates and FMCGs looking to gain more insights into consumer behaviour regarding sustainable packaging. Any firm looking to gain more perspective from the consumer point of view would find this paper beneficial. Firms or start-ups that are leading innovators in sustainable packaging solutions. It would help the better design the products by keeping in mind the behaviour of their consumers’ target market.  2. Literature review  Packaging practices in the FMCG industry are often excessive and unnecessarily harmful to the environment. The daily use of one-time-use plastic in the form of bottles, containers, and wrappers has proven to be highly wasteful. We thoroughly reviewed over 30 articles and papers for this literature review. A great emphasis is put on how much the products we use every day impact the environment, and rightfully so. Some of the papers we reviewed focused on an alternative to one-time-use plastics, like PET and other polymers. Others even spoke about 100% edible biodegradable materials made from natural products. However, these prove to be relatively expensive options for companies and buyers. We also reviewed various papers focusing on consumer buying behavior in terms of packaging. Urban crowds and the younger generation consider sustainable packaging more while buying than others. However, most consumers think the product's price is over its sustainability, It was also found that age and education do not significantly impact buying behavior. The use of appropriate material, proper shape, and the correct packaging labeling have positively affected consumers’ view of the usability of a product's packaging.  On the other hand, the shade and size of packaging do not seem to impact consumers’ view of the usability of a product's packaging. It is also seen that elements like media exposure and packaging strategies better influence buyers’ buying behavior. Businesses today need to provide more innovative packaging solutions and designs to market their products.Bettering their environmental performance is the most significant way organi zations can heighten their corporate social responsibility and improve their brand image.  In their paper “Do altruistic and egoistic values influence consumers’ attitudes and purchase intentions towards eco-friendly packaged products? An empirical investigation”, Gyan Prakash, Sangita Choudhary, Anil Kumar, Jose Arturo Garza-Reyes, Syed Abdul Rehman Khan, Tapan Kumar Prakash et al. (2019) have tried to determine and analyze the link between altruistic and values of consumers and their purchasing decisions. Their study analyzed data from 277 young Indian consumers. The investigation eventually showed that the philanthropic values of consumers have a more significant effect on the consumers’ buying decisions than egoistic values. The responses recorded were about ecological packaging.  Lavuri Rambabu and Ramlal Porika’s paper on the topic “Packaging strategies: knowledge outlook on consumer buying behavior” focuses on understanding the importance of packaging strategies as a marketing tool (Rambabu and Porika, 2020). The study aims to analyze the impact of packaging strategies on consumer buying behavior in various scenarios. They gathered data from 836 unique respondents from 4 major cities, age no bar. It concluded that the type of packaging is highly impactful, and innovative strategies more in touch with the consumer needs to be developed and adopted.  Akanksha Singhal and Garima Malik of Amity University, Noida, researched “The attitude and purchasing of female consumers towards green marketing related to the cosmetic industry.” (Aakanksha Singhal et al., 2018) Their study aimed to determine a correlation between female consumers regarding specific demographics and their behavior towards green marketing in the cosmetic industry. They researched with a sample of 100 females from Delhi. They found that while age and education level had almost negligible impact on women's attitude towards green cosmetic products, the income level did.  A significant difference was seen in women's responses from different income levels and societal classes. They also determined a negative relationship between female consumers’ attitudes and green cosmetic products.  The paper on “Sustainable Consumer Behaviour: A Collection of Empirical Studies” by Gerrit Antonides summarises all the contributions made to Sustainable Consumer Behaviour and puts them in perspective (Antonides, 2017). The paper provides an insight into the various articles published on this topic in the past.  An article published in the British Food Journal by Giancristofaro, Rosa Arboretti and Paolo Bordignon on “Consumer preferences in food packaging: cub models and conjoint analysis” looks into forms of food packaging, both cookable and disposable (Giancristofaro and Bordignon, 2015). Data is collected from 205 respondents divided between cookable and disposable packaging. The research found that oven-cookable and biodegradable have the highest levels of utility.  The study conducted by Manijeh Bahrainizad and Azadeh Rajabi published in the Journal of Islamic Marketing aims to understand the consumers’ perception of the usability of packaging for impulse purchase items based on various factors like material, size, shape, and colour (Bahrainizad and Rajabi, 2018). The material aspect of this study was of primary interest for this paper. The study showed that apart from mood and time pressure, material and usability of packaging showed a positive influence over impulse buying decisions. However, size and shape did not significantly impact impulse buying decisions.  Mehmet Seckin Aday Ugur Yener's study on “Assessing consumers’ adoption of active and intelligent packaging” showcases consumers’ buying behaviour regarding innovative packaging techniques for food items. The results showcased that consumers’ who prioritize price first and foremost would be willing to pay for innovative packaging, provided the price increase was lesser than 10%. However, some consumers also showed concern over the misleading nature of creative packaging. A majority of the respondents concluded that communicating innovative packaging through advertisements would be the most effective way of gaining overall acceptance.  “Impact of Eco-Friendly Products on Consumer Behaviour” by Chandigarh Business School professors Ms. Preeti Sehgal and Ms. Neha Singh proved extraordinarily insightful and beneficial for our study. (Singhal and Malik, 2018) They aimed to find the association between the generous nature of consumers and the purchase of green products. Their results showed that exposure to more green products than traditional products brings excellent value to consumers. However, this charitable value does not always convert into the purchase of green products. The vagueness surrounding the authenticity and credibility of eco-labels on the packaging often deter consumers from making the purchase. Consumers also green products to be pricier than traditional products. As a result, though consumers today have become more aware of their product choices, the market for those who go out of their way to look for and buy green products remains a niche.      Agnieszka Lorek’s paper published in the Environmental and Economic Studies journal talks about the “Current trends in the consumer behavior towards eco-friendly products.” (Lorek, 2015) The paper's purpose was to identify the current trends regarding green consumerism limited to a neighbourhood. The author finds that while this trend has its popular and unpopular phases, most consumers’ prices remain significant. Those who prefer eco-friendly products are more attracted to energy saving. “Understanding plastic packaging: The co-evolution of materials and society” by David M. Evans, Rorie Parsons, Peter Jackson, Sarah Greenwood, and Anthony Ryan highlights the evolution of plastic packaging through the years. (David M. Evans et al., 2020) It gives valuable insights into plastic and other packaging materials and their evolution alongside society. Plastic has been considered harmful to the environment, and this knowledge is shared amongst today's manufacturers and consumers alike. The paper also dives into the alternative and invention to substitute plastic packaging.  While the paper on “Role of plastics additives for food packaging” by Preeti Singh, Sven Saengerlaub, Ali Abas Wani, and Horst-Christian Langowski doesn't directly correlate to our research question, it gives an essential insight into the importance of plastic additives in food packaging (Singh et al., 2012). We believe the importance and relevance of this item would pose a considerable hindrance in an attempt to eliminate plastic in packaging materials.  Jun Heo and Siddharth Murlidharan’s paper on “Whaat triggers young Millennials to purchase eco-friendly products?” dives deep into understanding the “the interrelationships among knowledge, perceived consumer effectiveness, and environmental concern” affecting millennials’ purchase decisions concerning eco-friendly products. (Heo and Muralidharan, 2019) Online research among millennials showed that environmental knowledge and consciousness are significant drivers of environmentally conscious consumer behavior among this age group.  Ewa Jerzyk’s study on “Design and Communication of Ecological Content on Sustainable Packaging in Young Consumers’ Opinions” gives valuable insights into the opinions and thoughts of young consumers on the design, style, and communication of green products. (Jerzyk, 2015) Students were asked questions about ecological messages on packaging and their impact. With the growing awareness and sensitivity around environmental concerns, it is vital to understand what the consumer interprets from the message conveyed and where it differs from the actual intent of the message.  “Communicating packaging eco-friendliness” by Lise Magnier and Dominique Crié strives to explore consumer perception towards eco-designed packaging. (Magnier and Crié., 2015) The purpose was to examine the various factors contributing to consumers’ response to eco-designed packaging. The paper offers a detailed view of the same and the perceived benefits and sacrifices from the consumers’ perspective.  “Consumer reactions to sustainable packaging"" by Lise Magnier and Jan Schoormans studies the “interplay of visual appearance, verbal claim, and environmental concern."" (Magnier and Schoormans, 2015) They conducted two studies on detergent and mixed nuts packages to observe consumer responses to the verbal sustainability claims and the visual appearance of these products on buying decisions. The study showed that environmental concern among the sample influences the answer in both criteria.  In an attempt to better understand consumer choices, Paola Mancini, Andrea Marchini, and Mariarosaria Simeone conducted a study on “Which are the sustainable attributes affecting the real consumption behaviour?” (Mancini et al,, 2017), For their research, they divided their sample into two focus groups and conducted three rounds of discussions to gain better insights apart from their empirical research. One of the key highlights of their findings was the correlation between education and consumer attitude and behavior towards consumption.  Garca Martinhoa, Ana Pires, Goncalo Portela, Miguel Fonseca’s paper on “Factors affecting consumers’ choices concerning sustainable packaging during product purchase and recycling,” as the name suggests, also talks about the various factors that consciously or subconsciously affect purchasing decisions of consumers. Their study was based on online data derived from 215 Portugal respondents where one group placed importance on eco- friendly packaging. In contrast, the others did not consider packaging in their purchase decision cycle.  Anh Thu Nguyen, Lukas Parker, Linda Brennan, and Simon Lockrey's paper on “A consumer definition of eco-friendly packaging” aims to understand what consumers mean by eco-friendly packaging (Nguyen et al., 2020). The study was conducted among three focus groups of diverse age groups. The study aimed to understand what factors make consumers believe that a particular product is eco-friendly. The results showcased three different criteria: manufacturing technology adopted, packaging material used, and the product's market appeal. However, while consumers have a diverse understanding of eco-friendly products, their knowledge in this area is mainly limited to packaging material.  “Social Aspect of Sustainable Packaging” by Norbisimi Nordin and Susan Selke believes that the success of sustainable packaging depends on both technological developments and social aspects. (Nordin and Selke, 2010) While much earlier have looked into technological developments for sustainable packaging, the author tries to fill in the gaping hole left behind in researching the social aspects of sustainable packaging.  Dr. D. Geetha and D. Annie Jennifer conducted “a study on consumer behaviour towards purchasing eco-friendly products in Coimbatore.” (Geetha and Jenifer, 2014) The aim was to understand consumer behaviour when purchasing eco-friendly products and the factors influencing said behaviour and its problems. They researched the means of a structured survey questionnaire. For their study, they selected a sample size of 100 green consumers from the city of Coimbatore. The paper involved results as well as suggestions from the authors. The conclusion was that there is a positive correlation between consumer behavior and eco-friendly products. Green consumerism seems to be on the rise in Coimbatore.  Lyndsey Scott and Debbie Vigar-Ellis conducted and documented a study to gain insights into consumers’ understanding, behaviour, and perceptions concerning environment-friendly packaging goods (Scott and Vigar-Ellis, 2014). For their paper, “Consumer understanding, perceptions, and behaviours about environmentally friendly packaging in a developing nation,” they uniquely conducted a study amongst the people of South Africa, where the idea of green consumption is still nascent and evolving. It was noted that the level of knowledge and awareness about sustainability and green consumption was pretty low among the citizen of the developing nation of South Africa.  Rajan Sharma and Gargi Ghoshal gave incredible insights into the “Emerging trends in food packaging, “ (Sharma and Ghoshal, 2018). Their research was based on analyzing the products readily available in the market presently. Their study showed that the consumers had appreciated packaging solutions for food packaging. The paper mainly discusses the current trends and practices being followed by manufacturers. They also emphasized intelligent packaging aspects like QR/Barcodes, sensors, etc., and their contribution towards increasing the product's ease of use.  Jay Singh, Abraham B. (Rami) Shani, Hillary Femal, and Ahmed Deif’s study on “packaging’s role in sustainability” look into the degree of impact packaging of a product would have on the product's overall sustainability (Singh et al., 2016). Thought the paper mainly revolves around “reusable plastic containers in the agricultural-food supply chains,” we believe correlations can be made to apply this research to the FMCG industry. Unlike the other papers we have reviewed so far, this study examines the economic advantages and disadvantages of adopting reusable containers in packaging. They conducted empirical research to establish and examine the linkage between reusable plastic containers’ economic and social impact and benefits. It also explores a little into the implications of this adoption. They researched grocery retailers who have tried both one-time-use and reusable plastic containers. Usage of reusable plastic containers showed lesser waste and damage of products, thereby proving more socially and economically beneficial.  “Development of a Supporting Tool for Sustainable FMCG Packaging Designs” by Srinath Srinivasan and Wen F. Lu looks into the various developments in terms of alternatives to plastic packaging. (Srinivasan and Lu, 2014) The critical components kept in mind while developing a supporting tool for packaging designing were the cost of the material, impact on the environment, value creation, and appeal to the consumer. The paper provides various comparisons in packaging to assist in evaluating them.  Kees Sonneveld, Karli James, Leanne Fitzpatrick, and Helen Lewis’ paper on “Sustainable Packaging: How do we Define and Measure It?” gives us a better understanding of sustainable packaging and what does and does not fall under this category of products (Sonneveld et al., 2005). It aims to define sustainability based on its social and economic systems. The three main elements considered are economic characteristics and social and environmental functions. The definition also differs between various levels of concern from the well-being of society, the product's effectiveness, zero waste cycles, and safe and non-toxic materials used.  “The Impact of Environmental Concern and Awareness on Consumer Behaviour"" by Julijana Angelovska, Snezana Bilic Sotiroska, and Nina Angelovska aims to establish a correlation between the increase in environmental awareness and consumer behaviour. (Angelovska et al., 2012) The main research question was to understand the changes in consumer behaviour towards eco-friendly products and packaging with changes in levels of environmental awareness and concern. The study concluded that individuals more aware and concerned about the ecological impacts of their product choices are more likely to pot for eco-friendly products. By this conclusion, increasing the consumer base for eco-friendly products is by educating the consumer about the impact on the environment and its implications.  Natalia Vila-Lopez and Innes Kuster-Boluda conducted “A bibliometric analysis on packaging research” more inclined “towards sustainable and healthy packages.” (Vila-L6pez and Kiister-Boluda, 2020) The paper covers the impact of marketing decisions on product packaging in various disciplines. The authors reviewed a total of 1170 scientific papers for this bibliometric research. Their research concluded that two sectors had been the focal point of most research from a marketing point of view over the years, namely, food and tobacco. However, recently a shift towards sustainable and healthy packaging has been observed.  “Applying an attitude network approach to consumer behaviour towards plastic” by Maria V. Zwicker, Hannah U. Nohlen, Jonas Dalege, Gert-Jan M. Gruter, and Frenk van Harreveld (Zwicker et al., 2020). Utilizing a disposition network approach, they researched individuals’ affiliations towards traditional and bio-based plastic to create an experimentally based way to deal with start mentality and conduct change. With a subjective report (N=97), they refined 25 evaluative responses (for example, convictions, feelings, and practices) that include individuals’ perspectives towards utilizing (bio-based) plastic. These responses were used to make another scale, accordingly tried among 508 online members. The following information was then used to construct an organization showing connections between members’ evaluative responses regarding plastic use.  After thoroughly studying multiple research papers on sustainable packaging, eco-friendly items, bio-degradable material, intelligent packaging, etc., we can conclude that extensive research has been done on this topic. However, what remains lesser known is applying these methods in FMCGs. Introducing eco-friendly packaging in FMCG is beneficial for the environment around us and in line with what the consumer demands today. There is a plethora of research available to study consumer buying behaviour. This study aims to get insights into consumer behaviour specifically to eco- friendly and sustainable packaging in the FMCG sector in India, correlating the Indian market with those markets on whom there is plenty of research available,  3. Research methodology  The research began with a thorough analysis of 30 papers and articles on this topic. The research design entails the use of carefully crafted questions asked during moderated focus group sessions to get a deeper and more accurate understanding of consumer perception and behaviour towards the packaging of their regularly purchased products. The questions are designed in a way to get the most unfiltered responses.The questions provide demographic information of our sample size. It will also offer us an insight into their buying patterns and behaviour and how eco-friendly and sustainable packaging plays a role in it.  While numerous papers are available to understand consumer behaviour better, there aren't many offering to understand it from sustainable packaging. The research gaps that this paper attempts to overlap is the study of consumer behaviour and perception towards eco-friendly and sustainable packaging, mainly in the FMCG industry in India. Also, to study and evaluate viable and cost-efficient options and alternatives for FMCG firms.  The study harnesses an empirical method to conduct the research and gather insights. The research is based on qualitative data collected through various articles published in journals. A majority of the data is collected through a literature review. We also conducted focus group sessions to gain better insights into our topic. The focus group comprised ten individuals from metropolitan and tier 1 cities in India, with different socio-economic statuses. It was a moderated focus group where questions were asked and recorded responses were. After this, we also conducted an unmoderated session with the same participants to better understand, The goal was to benefit from theoretical knowledge through our literature review and the practical, real- life application through the focus groups.  4. Results and discussion     We conducted a focus group discussion among ten individuals from India’s metropolitan and tier 1 cities. The participants were dynamic, with various age groups and socioeconomic classes represented. The focus group was conducted virtually over Google Meet, and the participants were asked to turn off their cameras to ensure utmost honesty and comfort from all of them. They were asked to be as frank as possible. The questions were asked to gain more insights into the consumer's mindset and thought process while making a purchase. We asked them to introduce themselves without their name, stating their age, gender, religion, city, profession, etc. We continued to ask questions, with each of them responding individually first and then discussing amongst themselves. The records from the focus group session are indicated appendix section.  The focus group helped us put all the various takes we observed in the research papers. We observed a pattern of increased environmental consciousness and awareness with the increase in education level.  Correlating to that, we also noticed that the younger generation, especially those still in school and being taught about the environmental impacts of everyday life, are more aware and concerned about making sustainable choices. The generation before them seems to be more driven by the price and utility factor. However, it was also observed that the younger generation considers prices a constraint. Still, unlike the older generation, environmental impact is one of the first concerns when making a purchase. We also observed that the lack of awareness is rampant in the older generation, and most of those who are aware are also relatively unsympathetic. The result from both the focus group sessions seemed to more or less confirm the general idea we ascertained from the literature review. The need for sustainable packaging is visible; however, the gap between that need and FMCG's ability to match it is also apparent. Overall, it was observed that factors like education and awareness along with the drive to make a change really boost the purchase of sustainably packed goods. Additionally, words like natural, organic, biodegradable further drive the purchase. On the other hand, price is one of the biggest factors deterring purchase. Customers’ presumption of sustainable products being inherently expensive hinders them from making the  purchase. Also, a lack of knowledge about the benefits offered by sustainable products makes them indifferent towards it.  5. Conclusion  The study has noticed a positive correlation between increased awareness about the environment and consideration of the impact of purchases among consumers, Most people do not believe their actions will significantly change the environment, so they prefer staying in their comfort zone. We recommend brands educate their consumers on the impact of eco-friendly, sustainable green products on the environment and how each consumer can make a difference, While exploring consumer behaviour towards sustainable packaging, this study fails to explore viable alternatives to the current packaging materials. We believe further research could be conducted to understand better the alternative economical packaging materials available in the market. A study could further be conducted to explore the different alternative materials, their cost, and their effect on the environment. Another interesting study, we believe, would be to understand customer behaviour towards change in packaging. Customers are often used to seeing their frequent purchases in a certain package or colour combination. It would be interesting to study their behaviour and purchase decision"

Large amounts of packaging produced today Aweekly briefing    cannot be recycled in existing recycling systems. This is especially true  for multi-material packaging, which today poses a significant and  unresolved challenge in recycling.    Packaging recycling and leakage. Recycling rates for plastic    packaging are relatively low. In the United States, for example, waste is generally  managed with low leakage but recovery rates for packaging and food-service plastics  are about 28 percent. In Europe, the plastic-packaging recycling rate reported was  somewhat higher at approximately 40 percent, compared to approximately 80 percent  for paperboard, and 75-80 percent for metal and glass'*! (note, however, that overall  data collection quality on recycling rates is rather immature, so real-world rates may  differ from reported figures). Emerging regions (Asia in particular) are under the most  pressure, because packaging demand growth is outpacing global growth rates, and  waste-collection systems—let alone recycling—are not in place at the required scale.  Global leakage or unmanaged dumps of all plastic material flows (both durable and  non-durable) is estimated to be around 19 percent, and only 16 percent of all plastic  waste is re-processed to make new plastics. In fact, most of the global plastics waste  goes into incineration (25%) and landfills (40%), meaning that these materials are lost    forever as a resource, despite plastics’ potential for reuse and recycling.    This has not gone unnoticed; public awareness of packaging waste leakage, especially  plastic waste, into the environment has increased significantly to an all-time high over  the past 12-24 months. The visceral images of the effects of ocean plastics pollution  have stirred up consumer sentiment around the world.    Governments have started to  respond to the public outcry    Governments, on all continents, have responded to public concerns regarding  packaging waste, especially single-use packaging waste, and are implementing  regulations to both minimize environmental waste and improve waste-management  processes (Exhibit 1).

For example, in the US 16  states have enacted statewide regulations around packaging waste, which tend to  target single-use plastics, shopping bags, and increasing recycling targets'*) Several  more bills are pending to be approved over the next 3 years. Meanwhile, Europe has  progressed further than some other regions when it comes to sustainability. Measures  announced in May 2019, under the “New EU Directive for Single-Use Plastics,” aim to  reduce leakage of the ten single-use plastic products most often found on European  beaches.(5! Additionally, some countries—in particular France,!©! Germany, and the  United Kingdom—are going above and beyond the already robust recycling regulations  across the European Union with Extended Producer Responsibilities (EPRs). These  countries are implementing even more aggressive targets, fees for introducing non-  recyclable packaging, and additional legislation such as only using recyclable  packaging, setting higher recycling targets, and so on.    In Asia, Thailand recently announced a nationwide ban on single-use plastic bags at  major stores effective January 1, 2020, and aims for a full ban by 2021 to reduce plastic  leakage into the environment.”! India has shelved plans for a full ban of single-use  plastics for now, but is pushing for increased awareness campaigns and more collection  points to improve collection and curb waste.'*! China has banned imports of plastics  waste and approved legislation to ban/reduce single-use plastics, increase recycling,  recovery, and recirculation of used plastics. Latin America had relatively low  commitments to sustainability with few regulations in place through the early 2000s.  However, in the past few years there has been a considerable rise in awareness:  between 2016 and 2019 many local and federal bills have been approved or proposed  in countries across the region. For example, Chile is banning plastic bags for business  and Mexico City'®! is banning single-use plastics.

Almost all the top 100 FMCG  companies (in terms of revenue) have made bold declarations and commitments to drive  sustainability over the coming years. Our research shows that these commitments focus  on three areas of activity (Exhibit 3): emphasis on full recyclability and a significant  higher degree of recycled content are the most widely embraced initiatives, accounting  for 60 percent of commitments; this is followed by a reduction of total plastics usage  (26 percent) and by the innovation and promotion of change in the use of packaging (14  percent).

As a result, FMCG  manufacturers and retailers are beginning to experiment with complete packaging  redesigns and a fundamental rethinking of their delivery chains (including circular  delivery models). They are also looking to curb plastic-waste generation by  experimenting with use of metal and glass in returnable systems. In effect, major brands  are starting to self-regulate.    In one recent example, a US company launched laundry detergent in new packaging  specifically for online orders. The detergent was reformulated to be more concentrated,  and its packaging designed to reduce its overall weight to be lighter than the original  version in transit. Handling has been improved with a plastic sleeve that fits snugly  inside a rectangular cardboard package. In addition, this hybrid mix of substrates adds  a further sustainability benefit by using 60 percent less plastic than previously, although  we should note that composites can be harder to recycle. In another example, a  consortium of leading brands, a logistics provider, and a recycler recently teamed up to  test the concept of returnable and reusable packaging—in effect reviving the concept  of a “milk man.” The pilot has been rolled out during 2019 in areas of Paris and New  York; however, the jury is still out on how much potential exists to justify future scale-up.

It should be noted, however, that  curbing use of plastic packaging and changing packaging materials comes at a cost in  terms of additional complexities and trade-offs, many of which will be far from trivial:    FMCGs and retailers will have to face complicated trade-offs such as  recyclability versus carbon footprint and food waste.    Not all types of actions have the same impact on the different aspects of the  sustainability footprint.    Technical and economic feasibility varies by plastic type and application, as well  as by geographic region, and cost implications go beyond just packaging  material prices and conversion costs.!"")    Any packaging material or design change has implications on overall branding  strategy, and large portfolios comprised of different plastics, applications, and  geographies make strategizing highly complex.    The new challenges around waste management and recyclability are taking FMCG  companies and retailers into new and unfamiliar territory. In the past, these  organizations have pursued a relatively narrow packaging sustainability agenda that has  focused substantially on “lightweighting.” Successfully addressing the new recyclability  and waste challenges is likely to stretch the capabilities of their current tools and  strategies. Consequently, FMCG companies and retailers will require much closer  collaboration with upstream players, packaging converters, and recyclers to  successfully deal with these new challenges. One key area is the need to build  infrastructure to manage increased recycling by employing more closed systems (that  is, bottle-to-bottle recycling to avoid downcycling).'?! Another area is to coordinate  changes with film converters and recycling infrastructure to build recovery capability to  accept polyolefin multi-substrate films, which could allow for a much larger amount of  flexible packaging and other multi-material packaging to be recycled. This also involves  developing and scaling more advanced recycling technologies, for example, where the  packaging can be converted to liquid hydrocarbons using pyrolysis or gasification, to  be used for fuels or as feedstock for producing “new” plastic with similar performance  as “virgin-based”    These types of developments could mark a watershed in the relationship between the  FMCG manufacturers and retailers on one hand and the packaging converters on the  other. Traditionally, packaging converters have played the role of the compliant supplier  to their larger and more powerful brand-owning customers. However, as FMCG  companies and retailers discover the need to move from an arm's length relationship  with suppliers to more of a partnership and collaborative approach, new opportunities  could emerge for packaging converters—particularly for agile converters that are able  to quickly expand their innovation capabilities.    Converters are moving forward on  sustainability, but are they doing  enough?    The new pressures to reduce the environmental impact of packaging, comply with  regulations, and satisfy consumer preferences are going to require packaging    converters to make new investments and undertake major scale-up of their innovation  capacity.    This will be an important adjustment in innovation. Apart from  lightweighting/downgauging, currently many packaging companies have their  sustainability efforts primarily focused internally on improving energy efficiency and  waste reduction, with some limited work starting on applications innovation for  sustainable packaging solutions across substrates. This inevitably implies a gap  between the need to support the sustainable packaging aspirations of the FMCG  companies and retailers, and the range of development initiatives being undertaken by  the packaging converters.    Examples of this gap include the fact that innovative application solutions that offer  higher recyclability today are far from being as cost- and as barrier-efficient as  incumbent solutions. Successful sustainability innovations will need to be at a neutral or  affordable cost trade-off to gain scale. Equally, many application innovations seem to be  difficult to scale up beyond the smaller initiatives currently in place; this is partly due to  the fact they are often at an early stage in the research process and use costly  materials.    Today, it is upstream substrate producers that appear to be taking the innovation lead in  sustainable packaging. These players are working on top-priority areas such as mono-  materials!""! with “high-barrier” properties that can also offer high recyclability, or  incorporate recycled content. Among paper and board producers, there is innovation  work under way on high-barrier materials to replace plastics using bio-derived  products, most of which are recyclable, compostable, or both. For example, several  specialty paper producers are developing flexible paper-based packaging with water-  based coatings that can act as barriers for vapor, oxygen, and oil, and can therefore  replace plastic/aluminum laminate packages, among other types of laminates. Others  are working on creating lighter and stronger packaging board that offers lower carbon  footprint while providing sufficient barrier properties. For example, one producer is  including Micro-Fibrillated Cellulose (MFC) in its paper board to create lighter, stronger  packaging board that also uses less virgin material.    Plastic film producers, meanwhile, are pushing hard to develop mono-material (such as  all-polyethylene) packaging solutions, which are fully recyclable at the end of their  lifecycle and can replace today’s multi-material flexible plastic packaging that cannot  be recycled with today’s processing technology. There is also substantial work under  way to develop more food-safe-grade plastic films incorporating recycled content. This  development will increase the use of recycled materials in the large quantities of flexible  packaging that are used today for food    At the same time, a number of producers of virgin plastic resin have acquired plastics  recycling processors, which is giving them the potential to add recycled plastic to their  portfolio of resin offerings. Having these products available would make it much easier  for converters that want to include recycled content in their products. Similarly, resin  producers are developing polymers based on feedstock made from chemical recycling  of plastic waste; this feedstock can replace oil- and gas-based feedstock in  manufacturing plastic substrates used for packaging materials, and packaging end-  products can then be tagged as made from “recycled” plastic.    Approach to target opportunities in  sustainable packaging    Converters can strategically best position themselves to support FMCG companies and  retailers on sustainable packaging by recognizing that:    FMCG manufacturers will continue to need to manage cost efficiency of  packaging solutions and a high degree of customer convenience—for example,  easy-opening products and packaging designed for on-the-go consumption.    Not all types of actions will have the same impact on the various aspects of the  sustainability footprint (for example, low food waste versus recyclability—using a  high-barrier packaging material or multilayer film can significantly increase shelf  life and minimize the amount of food waste along the chain, but the packaging  itself may be less recyclable).    Different end-product segments will have varying sensitivity to sustainability.    Technical and economic feasibility varies by application as well as geographic  region, and cost implications go beyond just packaging material prices and  conversion costs.    Any change of packaging material or design has implications on overall branding    strategy.    The future of packaging:  Smart bottles, edible boxes    See the collection >         There is no one-size-fits-all solution that converters can embrace as they work on  strategies for sustainable packaging with their FMCG and retailer customers. There are  complexities and trade-offs to consider if they are to navigate through these  sustainability challenges in order to find the most effective route to growing and  preserving value with application innovations. To chart their course, we suggest that  converters consider a three-part approach to help them identify opportunities.    Step 1: Low-hanging fruit    The “low-hanging fruit” group of opportunities offers packaging converters some no-  regret moves, where they can double down on product segments where barriers to  switch are low, and most of the work can be done by the individual converter and FMCG  company without broader value chain coordination. These opportunities will typically be  product segments where all of the actions can be taken with close to zero impact on  operating cost or capital expenditure needs, functionality, or attractiveness of the  packaging, including:    « Removing unnecessary use of packaging. While lightweighting has been ongoing  for a long time, there are still plenty of applications where packaging can be  replaced with lighter-weight materials.    Developing existing packaging. Increase usage of recycled content in less  sensitive applications (for instance, non-food), while also considering different  types of plastic that could improve the product's sustainability profile. This also  should include packaging design for easy use and recycling (e.g., clarity for  consumers on how packaging should be collected and sorted at recycling  stations).    Material substitution. Introduce more mono-materials and decrease the  complexity of the combinations of different materials used, while retaining the  ability to produce the same type of packaging and requiring no change in its  structural design.    * Communicating the sustainability narrative of your current products better.    Step 2: Harder but doable    In contrast, the “harder but doable” group of applications requires building an approach  from the ground up, which will also require collaboration with upstream and  downstream partners. One recent example of such a collaboration involved a dairy  customer partnering with a packaging converter and upstream suppliers of raw  material to fully redesign its packaging. The new design uses liquid carton board and  recycled plastics that are claimed to have a 50 percent lower environmental impact  than polystyrene-based packaging. The important lesson learned here was to think  through what partnerships would be needed to innovate “game-changing” packaging  solutions that are truly designed for sustainability.    Step 3: System-level changes    The third group of initiatives falls under the heading of “System-level changes.’ To truly  achieve significant progress toward sustainable packaging, changes to the broader  packaging and recycling system will be required where development and    implementation costs are also much higher—and will he difficult ta achieve by individual |  stakeholders.

6,Webscrapping-6,"waste is a two-sided problem in the consumer goods industry. On the one hand, some products are disposed of for various reasons, and on the other, waste is generated through packaging. FMCG companies have been producing an increasing amount of waste and single-use plastic. Companies need to be more mindful of the waste generated throughout their value chain. Companies like Procter & Gamble and Dabur India recently claimed that they have achieved 'plastic waste neutrality’ by recycling a big chunk of their post-consumer plastic packaging waste. They have come under pressure to manage waste to be environmentally friendly and raise consumer awareness. Environmentally conscious companies are better able to draw in new clients since customers like to work with businesses that share their values In 2021, LVMH, Nestle, Philip Morris International, Unilever, and British American Tobacco are the major FMCG companies in the world that generated significant waste. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (LVMH) is a luxury goods manufacturer and marketer with a market capitalization of $298 billion as of October 2022. In 2021, LVMH generated 113.6 thousand tonnes of waste, an increase of 41% from 2020. In the same year, 103.4 thousand tonnes of waste generated (91% of total waste generated) by the company was recovered. LVMH plans to use 70% recycled raw materials in its packaging by 2030. Nestle SA (Nestle) is a manufacturer and marketer of food products and beverages with a market capitalization of $291 billion as of October 2022. The total waste generated by Nestle in 2021 was 1,568 thousand tonnes of which 99% of the waste was non-hazardous. The company has set a goal to make 100% of its packaging recyclable or reusable and reduce the use of virgin plastics by one-third by 2025. Philip Morris International Inc (PMI) is a manufacturer and distributor of cigarettes, tobacco-related products, and other nicotine-containing products and had a market capitalization of $133 billion as of October 2022. The waste generated by Philip Morris International in 2021 was 114 thousand tonnes, a decrease of 4.77% over 2020.  Unilever Plc (Unilever) is a manufacturer and supplier of fast-moving consumer goods with a market capitalization of $111 billion as of October 2022. In 2021, Unilever generated 659 thousand tonnes of total waste, an increase of 11% from 2020. Unilever aims to reduce the usage of virgin plastic by 50% and has set a target of using 25% of recycled plastic in its packaging by 2025. British American Tobacco plc (BAT) produces, markets, and sells cigarettes, tobacco and nicotine products, vapor and tobacco-heating products, and other tobacco-related products. The company had a market capitalization of $81 billion as of OCtober 2022. The waste generated by British American Tobacco in 2021 was 137 thousand tonnes which decreased by 4.9% over 2020.The company recycled 78.9% of the waste in 2021 which decreased by 1.6 percentage points over 2020. The company has set a goal to have a 95% recycling rate of total waste generated by 2025. The company has 75% of its packaging as reusable, recyclable, or compostable.  "
7,Webscrapping-7,"Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) corporations are a predominant force behind the throwaway economic model driving the plastic pollution crisis, according to a comprehensive sector survey Greenpeace International released today. None of the companies surveyed have plans to put the brakes on the growing production and marketing of single-use plastics, while the solutions they are exploring will only perpetuate the problem.  “We hoped to identify industry leaders through this process, but instead found that the whole sector has failed to take responsibility for the plastic pollution crisis and is instead trying to maintain the status quo,” said Ahmad Ashov, Global Plastics Project Leader, Greenpeace Indonesia. “There is a lack of transparency and all current public commitments by these companies allow for an increased use of single-use plastic in the future. That needs to change.”  “Their current business model is based on the assumption that ultimately all plastic packaging can, and will, be collected and recycled into new packaging or products.”  The four companies that reported the highest sales of single-use plastic products (Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestlé and Danone) were also the top four brands identified in a recent global Break Free From Plastic brand audit report following 239 plastic pollution cleanups in 42 countries.  Greenpeace’s report, “A Crisis of Convenience: The corporations behind the plastics pollution pandemic”, focuses on 11 of the biggest FMCG companies: Coca-Cola Company, Colgate-Palmolive, Danone, Johnson and Johnson, Kraft Heinz, Mars, Nestlé, Mondelez, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Unilever.  Key findings:  Single-use packaging is the main delivery system used by all of the FMCG companies, with no signs of changing.  None of the surveyed FMCG companies have comprehensive strategies that include commitments to move away from single-use plastic.  Most FMCG companies are actually increasing the amount of single-use plastic packaging and waste they produce.  Most FMCG companies know or disclose little about the amount of their packaging that is recycled and even less about the destination of their plastic waste after consumption.  Despite their significant plastic footprint, solutions being explored by businesses are primarily related to addressing recyclability or recycling, not reducing or creating new delivery systems.  There is a lack of transparency in the sector and few FMCG companies are willing to disclose important data about their plastic use.  The survey looked to determine the degree to which FMCG commitments, actions and performance are addressing the environmental and social impacts of their plastic packaging and waste.  “The sector urgently needs to change its business model and prepare for a world where disposable products and packaging are no longer acceptable,” said Ashov.  The FMCG sector represents one of the largest industries worldwide. Most FMCG companies are growing at rates between 1 – 6% each year.[1] If current trends continue, their use of single-use plastic will increase in parallel.    "
8,Webscrapping-8,"Procter & Gamble India has just announced that it has become ‘plastic waste neutral’ in the past year (April 2021 – March 2022). P&G has collected, processed, and recycled over 19,000 MT of post-consumer plastic packaging waste from across the country which is more than the amount of plastic packaging in its products sold in a year, said the company release. With this announcement, the company is among the first few FMCG companies in India to achieve plastic waste neutrality.  The company is working with recycling partners across 75 cities in India to collect plastic which is then sent to different recyclers, waste to energy plants, and cement kilns. In addition to recycling, the company said it has also made a deliberate effort to reduce the packaging material and in the last 5 years has reduced usage of packaging material by more than 5,000 MT.  Last month Dabur India said it had become a complete plastic waste neutral firm in the country after collecting, processing and recycling around 27,000 metric tonnes of post-consumer plastic waste during Dabur had set the target of collecting, processing and recycling over 22,000MT of post-consumer plastic waste and has surpassed it three months ahead of schedule.  In the case of P&G India, the announcement was made during its ‘It’s Our Home Sustainability Summit’ held in Mumbai. During the summit, P&G India also announced that it will set up two more in-house solar plants at its manufacturing sites in Goa and Mandideep in India. This is in addition to the existing in-house solar plant that the company set up at its Hyderabad manufacturing site in 2021. With this, P&G will be among the first few FMCG companies in India to have three in-house solar plants across its manufacturing sites.  Madhusudan Gopalan, CEO, Procter & Gamble – Indian Sub-Continent said, “We are proud of the significant progress we have made on environmental sustainability, and achieving ‘plastic waste neutrality’ is a key milestone in this journey. Plastic waste does not belong in the environment, and we will continue to partner with multiple stakeholders in our efforts to reduce and recycle packaging waste.” He further added, “We are also taking a deliberate approach to reducing the impact of our operations, and setting up in-house solar plants is a step in this direction. We have made strong progress across our brands, our supply chain, our operations with support from our partners and employees. We are fully committed to making a positive impact in the world and creating a sustainable future for generations to come.”  The company informed that in recent years it has made significant progress on environmental sustainability which can be seen across its operations and brands. These include:  All P&G manufacturing sites in India are ‘zero manufacturing waste to landfill’  5 of P&G India sites have already achieved the 2030 P&G global target of 35% water efficiency  P&G India purchases 100% renewable electricity for all its manufacturing sites in India  The FMCG major has also set a new ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across its operations and supply chain, from raw material to retailer by 2040.   According to media reports, as of 2019, India generates more than 25,000 tonnes of plastic waste every day, 40 per cent of which remains uncollected and littered in the environment. Further, according to a study conducted by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in 60 major cities of India, around 4,059 tonnes per day of plastic waste is reportedly generated from these cities..  According to ChangeStarted.com, a forum for environmental issues, the FMCG industry is the biggest contributor to the packaging plastic waste generated. It cites statistics that in 2014, 95% of the total number of biscuits, dried processed food items, and hair care products; and 85% of dairy products, baked goods, laundry, and skincare sold in India were packaged in plastic. Further, according to government reports, India generates 10 MT per year of plastic waste from the FMCG sector and that India’s recycling rate is now at 60% against the global average of 20%.  While statistics very often do not depict the true story, the fact remains that for  plastic waste neutrality to become more widespread and part of the system would require efforts from all stakeholders in the eco system including retailers and consumers.

9,Webscrapping-9,"While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a deadline of October 2, 2019, for eradication of single-use plastic, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are working aggressively towards meeting their timelines of using 100% biodegradable plastic for packaging ready-to-eat products.  A lot of initiatives have been put in place to reduce, collect and recycle multi-layered plastic (MLP). Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles used for beverage products are being re-purposed to make apparels, footwear, furniture, etc, by many companies. Sharukh Khan, executive director - operations, Dabur India, said the company is aiming to become a plastic waste neutral company by March 2021. “This is being done by collecting, processing and recycling 20,000 metric tonnes (mt) of post-consumer plastic waste. With this, the company would be collecting 100% of the plastic waste it generates through its product packaging,” said Khan. However, players say a clear definition of what is single-use plastic in the Indian context is very crucial. According to industry players, items like plastic carry bags, plates, glasses, cups, cutlery, straws and take-away food containers and thermocol plates fall in this category. by Taboola Sponsored Links You May Like  Joining AI & ChatGPT course can change your life  I am not your servant': IndiGo crew member, passenger get into row over airline mealCNA They said the problem can largely be solved by embedding the concept of 5R – refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and recover. “It starts with educating consumers to avoid plastic use, if possible. The crucial step in achieving recycling or recovery is an effective source segregation. The challenge is mainly in terms of lack of the required infrastructure. The regulators should focus on systems for effective collection, recycle and recovery. A suitable extended producer responsibility (EPR) framework involving all the relevant stakeholders will help. We have allocated Rs 3.25 crore for EPR this year along with a lot of management time and attention. We have set our packaging targets for 2024-25. For our India operations, we will reduce packaging consumption per unit of production by 20% from 2017-18. We will also ensure that 100% of the packaging material we use is recyclable, reusable, recoverable or compostable,” said Rakesh Sinha, head - global supply chain, manufacturing and IT, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. PepsiCo India has been been working across states to collect, segregate and sustainably manage equivalent of 100% plastic packaging by 2021. It has partnered with organisations to upcycle plastic into creating utility products such as chairs, benches, tables, t-shirts, laptop bags -- for instance, six PET bottles are being used to make a t-shirt. “One of our key targets is to make 100% recyclable, compostable or biodegradable packaging by 2025 and we have been striving to design all packaging with the goal to achieve optimum results with utmost efficient use of material possible,”  a PepsiCo India spokesperson said. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) will move to 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025. The company is working with the government and other partners such as United Nations Development Programme on pilot projects for plastic waste management.  “We have also committed that 25% of all the plastic we use will come from recycled sources by 2025. We are working towards achieving this goal. We continually look at new ways to reduce, re-use, recycle and recover packaging and waste as we move towards becoming a zero-waste business. Globally, we have reduced nearly one-third of our packaging waste since 2010. We are committed to accelerating a transition to a circular economy, moving from the linear take-make-dispose model to a regenerative approach, which keeps materials at their highest value for as long as possible,” said an HUL spokesperson. ITC has been adopting a holistic approach based on packaging optimisation, use of polymers that allow higher levels of recycling and supporting municipal programmes on waste source segregation, collection, reuse and recycling. “Over 150 mt of post-consumer MLP was collected in Pune in partnership with a pioneering waste-pickers cooperative SWaCH and recycled as vegetable trays, flower pots, pallets, etc. Since its launch in June 2019, this programme is in the process of being scaled up to achieve an annual recycling target of 2,500 mt, ITC said. Nestlé India's plans to 100% recyclable/ reusable packaging by 2025. It has designed a project called '2 minute Safaai ke naam' in Dehradun and Mussoorie in November 2018, wherein consumers were incentivised by giving them a packet of Maggi noodle for every 10 empty packets. “We are working on developing more environment-friendly packaging materials. For single-use plastics at our out of home outlets, we are exploring alternative options. There are certain challenges in serving hot beverages in 100% paper-based options and we are trying to address that,” said a Nestlé India spokesperson. Coca-Cola's primary packaging is completely recyclable and does not consist of single-use plastic, it said. While continuing with sustainable packaging initiatives, it is redesigning and light-weighting packaging, increasing renewable and recycled material use supporting recycling programmes.  "
10,Webscrapping-10,"sustainability—particularly regulatory and public concerns around single-use packaging waste—is combining with other powerful trends1 to drive major changes in consumer packaging. Regulators are moving on the issue, and Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies and retailers are proactively making bold commitments to improve both the sustainability of their packaging and to fundamentally rethink their packaging systems.  There will be significant impact on packaging converters and their value chain, which could threaten the survival of many in the industry. However, for packaging converters with the right focus and innovation capabilities, the new landscape could offer significant growth and new partnership opportunities to support customers in revising their packaging portfolios. Going forward, converters will have to proactively embrace sustainability issues as consumer demands and regulatory requirements multiply.

An early view in 15 charts  Turning consumer and retail companies into software-driven innovators  Getting to the bottom of the teen mental health crisis  Sustainable and inclusive growth: A weekly briefing  Packaging is ubiquitous in our daily lives and enables minimization of food waste and overall product breakage with advanced convenience features2 at low costs. Over the past decade, the global packaging industry has enjoyed strong growth, driven by shifts in choice of substrates and expansion of new end-markets. Headline changes include the increased use of plastics to replace other substrates and accommodate consumers’ demand for convenience, but also the economic boom in China and other emerging regions.  However, widespread usage of single-use packaging containers has resulted in a heavy burden on the environment, and the management of packaging waste is facing a crisis due to two unresolved challenges:  Packaging recyclability. Large amounts of packaging produced today cannot be recycled in existing recycling systems. This is especially true for multi-material packaging, which today poses a significant and unresolved challenge in recycling.  Packaging recycling and leakage. Recycling rates for plastic packaging are relatively low. In the United States, for example, waste is generally managed with low leakage but recovery rates for packaging and food-service plastics are about 28 percent. In Europe, the plastic-packaging recycling rate reported was somewhat higher at approximately 40 percent, compared to approximately 80 percent for paperboard, and 75–80 percent for metal and glass3 (note, however, that overall data collection quality on recycling rates is rather immature, so real-world rates may differ from reported figures). Emerging regions (Asia in particular) are under the most pressure, because packaging demand growth is outpacing global growth rates, and waste-collection systems—let alone recycling—are not in place at the required scale. Global leakage or unmanaged dumps of all plastic material flows (both durable and non-durable) is estimated to be around 19 percent, and only 16 percent of all plastic waste is re-processed to make new plastics. In fact, most of the global plastics waste goes into incineration (25%) and landfills (40%), meaning that these materials are lost forever as a resource, despite plastics’ potential for reuse and recycling.  This has not gone unnoticed; public awareness of packaging waste leakage, especially plastic waste, into the environment has increased significantly to an all-time high over the past 12–24 months. The visceral images of the effects of ocean plastics pollution have stirred up consumer sentiment around the world.  Governments have started to respond to the public outcry  Governments, on all continents, have responded to public concerns regarding packaging waste, especially single-use packaging waste, and are implementing regulations to both minimize environmental waste and improve waste-management processes (Exhibit 1).

1,mp3,"It's going to take a while to heat up.  Chef Jagger Gordon hates the thought of people going hungry.  It smells delicious.  With a thriving catering business, he's almost always surrounded by food.  So he was shocked years ago when his young daughter came home from a sleepover  and told him there had been no breakfast for anyone.  I always thought there was enough food for everyone.  Why would someone not have food in their fridge in the morning?  The realization that poverty and hunger were so close to home  while also seeing the incredible amount of food that goes to waste in his industry  turns this caterer into a crusader.  We are feeding thousands of people a week and diverting tens of thousands of pounds a week.  A perfectly edible food that's decinal anthels.  His mission is to feed it forward with a number of projects like this grocery store.  The food here is practically free.  And people just pay what they can?  Yeah, it's more like donate what you can.  The workers are volunteers. The food donated by retailers.  Looks perfect, but it didn't sell fast enough and is no longer considered fresh enough for fussy consumers.  This would have been sold somewhere else most of this stuff.  So this was for sale everywhere.  This is rescued.  All this food and everything that I deal with is rescued food.  Rescued from the garbage heap, $31 billion worth a year just in Canada.  Food goes to waste on the farm, in transit, in processing plants, in restaurants and in our homes.  Now that's changing.  Last 20 years, our team has been focused on extracting waste from the supply chain.  Efficiency expert Martin Guch did the research that came up with that $31 billion figure.  And this project is the first of its type in the world.  Today he's telling a group of farmers about his newest project that will highlight where exactly waste occurs and how much it costs business.  We have this perception of affluence and abundance.  We can afford, most of us can afford to waste some food, whether we're an individual consumer or whether we're a business.  Hi, Lloyd.  Hi.  Nice to see you.  His project is being funded by Second Harvest, a social agency that distributed over 10 million pounds of surplus food  last year.  We know that there's so much more food that we're not accessing.  And that's one of the reasons we're doing this research is to find out, okay, where is this food?  Every morning, a team delivers truckloads of unsold food donated by big grocers.  But what we found was there was a lot of places that were smaller in scale that we weren't going to pick up from because we wouldn't send a truck there.  It just wasn't efficient.  So we created something called foodrescue.ca.  It's a web-based platform.  I kind of call it the e-harmony of food.  The site matches smaller donors and those in need.  A great idea, but still, as a society, we toss far too much food.  And that contributes to global warming.  Rotting food creates methane, a pollutant even worse than carbon dioxide.  That's what inspired this young company.  So this is the regular box that gets delivered weekly in Toronto and London.  It has basically produced that farmers can't sell to grocery stores and they usually end up throwing away in the garbage.  Cedric Samaha is with Flash Food, a startup that offers home delivery of less than perfect vegetables rejected by grocers.  For example, this potato, it's disfigured.  I feel like I've bought potatoes like that at the store before.  That's not that radical.  Yeah, most of them don't have a lot of issues. Like the cucumber the size sometimes is an issue so they won't send it through.  That looks perfect too.  Flash food is growing thanks to demand from customers like John Griffiths and Michelle Clark.  Having a box delivered which is food that would normally go to waste because it doesn't look perfect is great.  The service doesn't save them any money but the home delivery is convenient and they believe less waste will slow climate change.  This summer has been so hot that it's going to get worse.  Back with chef Jagger Gordon, he's taking his feed it forward idea to a new level.  He's come up with an app that will allow anyone to share their extra food.  You just take a picture of the product that you want to donate any food item that's still edible in good standing.  So a piece of pizza or even a truckload of tomatoes, you just take a picture of it.  It uploads to a map so that whoever wants it can come get it.  But the great thing is is every city can now be in competition of how who is saving how much food from the landfills and how much food is actually being given back to people in need.  So you're going to try and start that competition.  It's starting.  The app launches into the marketplace next month and many would say none too soon.  It's time to get on board what's being called a global food waste revolution.  Diane Buckner, CBC News, Toronto.  Europe has been ahead of the game when it comes to legislation around food waste.  In 2016, France became the first country in the world to ban supermarkets from throwing away or destroying unsold food.  The big retailers now have to donate those goods to food banks and charities or else face heavy fines.  Italy followed suit offering incentives to businesses who donate food to charities.  It's also cleared some of the hurdles around donating food that's just passed its expiry date.  That was a big concern for health and liability reasons."

5,mp3,"Hello, my name is Marcio and I'm here to share with you all a solution or various solutions to stop food waste. So in order to understand food waste, I would like to give a brief history of how we humans came to this problem that we are facing today and what is the origin of it. We go to this simple phrase that humans are smart. From the very beginning they know how to preserve food. So if we go back to pre -historical times and as soon as we invented fire, we already knew how to sun -dry some vegetables, some meat, but as soon as we invented fire, we knew also how to smoke food. Now we started to preserve food as humans because of a need, not because of a niche market or because it tastes better, but because we needed to survive long periods of winter without a crop. So we started to be a revolutionary, I would say, for the age that this technique appeared and we really knew how to do it in order to pass the winter, not just for ourselves, but we also started to know how to preserve food for our animals. So we evolved into this knowing how to preserve food and we found new techniques. We learned how to preserve with salt, we learned how to preserve with smoke, as I was saying before, we came to this amazing product that here in Spain they are actually very, very appreciated. I love a hamun, I can't avoid without eating it. And so we also learned how to preserve with honey, it's used still today in many, many recipes and in many countries, you can also use vinegar, so basically there's no doubt we know how to preserve food. But then something where we can't preserve food, we can't preserve it. and wrong. So from knowing how to preserve food to what it came the days of industrialization where food was starting to be produced in mass, it was not just for a need. We started to produce in terms of companies that want to achieve success and they really calculate the amount of products that they make with an expired date and they can afford to lose a percentage of it. They already have it assumed by the moment they produce that a part of that is going to go to waste. This has been happening in our daily life for the last 70 years at least. Not just the way we packaged food and preserved it, but the way we start to really overpackage food. So it was really easy to go to a farmer or a supermarket in the 40s, 50s, 60s and they have a variety of fruits, vegetables, meats. With very little packaging, suddenly everything we see these days, it's over packaged. So this was smoked and then it was kept and then it was wrapped. So here is like four products that were unnecessary for this food to arrive to my table. We continue into this and we went into making marketing. So now we sell products that actually the packaging and the branding costed more for the company than the actual food we're going to eat. We went really far. As you can see, we do all kind of products for all kind of people. Is it needed? Well, it's debatable. So some of them are quite funny really, but the actual truth is this is what we are living. So we've known for millennium how to preserve food, but we had a need to preserve that food. So that food was actually for us to bear the winter. It was us for it to bear a bed crop to be safe that all in our house can eat in bed times. Now these days things change drastically. As you can see here in the graphic, the last one is 2018 and this is the amount of food that is going to waste. Now this is a serious problem. As I was saying before, it will be so easy to go pick your grapes or your apples and now it's all over packaging, which creates, I would say, a few problems not to say a lot of problems. So number one is the amount of waste of products that were unneeded to package our food that end up in the bin. Now we end up selling all that bin to third world countries where we all like to go in holidays, but we also sell them our rubbish, which ends up in this kind of atmosphere, which is our atmosphere."
6,mp3,"I'm going to give you some of the secrets about how we make you buy what we want you to buy. So as a marketer, when I'm first giving you a product, what's my job? Well, my job is to make that it is the best innovation in food since, well, since sliced bread. But how do we do it? Well, I'm going to give you a really big example later that I'm going to break right down for you, but let's just start by looking at a few fun little things. So here we have Shreddies, an old favourite, been around for years, very popular in the UK and Canada, without changing a single little thing about that product, they re -marketed them and rebranded them as brand new diamond shaped Shreddies, food marketing genius right there. In the 1950s, there was a very important innovation in food, the Instant Mix Cake, one of my personal favourites. When they were first brought out, all you needed to do was to add a little bit of water. Who's not going to love that? Well, actually, no one loved it. No one bought the bloody things. So they did a bit of research, and what they found was that the main consumer, the target consumer, the housewife, felt that it was cheating. They didn't want to pass off such an easy thing as their own baking to their partners, their husbands, their families, whatever. So what did the producers have to do? They had to make it harder. So now you had to add water and an egg, and sales exploded. But these examples, these are just chicken feed compared to what I really want to talk about tonight, and that is chickens and pigs and cows. So when we think about where chickens, etc, come from, We think about something a bit like that. That's our instinctive idea, but we all know if we really think about it, if we think about it deeply, it's probably a little bit more like that. But that's a lot nicer. It's a lot more romantic. So how do we give you this impression? Well, there are three techniques that we use. The third of which is our secret weapon, and I am gonna blow it for you tonight, so please stay primed for that. Let's look at technique number one. Everybody believes what's on the label. So let's look at some examples. Some of my favorites, some of the ones I use all the time. I'll use Farm Fresh. I'll use 100% natural. I'll use Butcher's Choice. But what does that really actually mean? Well, truthfully, it doesn't mean very much. We see that on the label, we feel a bit more confident. But let's have a look at what a farm really looks like. It probably looks like that. Now, this is a concentrated animal feeding operation. I'm going to run that past you again. It's a concentrated animal feeding operation. That's not going to look great on a label. Hence, we use farm fresh. Innovation number two, this is what we use. We focus on progress. Intensive farming was born out of necessity. At the end of the Second World War, resources were extremely tight. Farming had to be, it had to be by necessity, very, very economical. And we've learned from that and we've built from that. And we were able to now raise more and more animals in smaller and smaller spaces. So we've got extremely good at it. If we looked at a room of about this size, and this would turn into a chicken barn, it's a 100 -seat theatre, how many chickens could it be? Probably fit in this room now. I'm going to say about 4 ,000. It's pretty impressive, isn't it? It'd probably look a little bit like that. Now, the public aren't going to be massively keen on that idea. And it's my job to make them feel a little bit better about it. So how do I do it? Well, a basic principle of marketing. We use the right choice of words. And by using the right choice of words, we can make the conversation, we can focus the conversation the way we want it to. So we're using an example like this. When you look at that picture, where is your eye drawn? It's drawn right to the middle of the page. Massive letters we've got strive to optimise. What we're looking at in the picture, in reverse, looks a bit like that. But this looks a lot nicer, because we're looking at strive to optimise. It makes us feel that there's progress. We feel good. So the challenge for the marketers is to make the public feel comfortable with what they're seeing. One of the side effects of intensive farming, of having so many animals in such a small space, unfortunately, is obviously disease, because you put so many animals into a small space, they're going to get sick. It is no secret that 50% of all the antibiotics in the world are used on farmed animals. So how do you make the public feel okay with this? How does that happen? My job. How do I do it? I use the language of innovation."
7,mp3,"Who here likes pasta? Wow, applause for pasta .I think we have basic unanimity on pasta.I love pasta too. And fortunately I have nine plates of pasta from a local Italian restaurant.It is fantastic. Who would like to eat a plate of pasta while I give this talk? Yes, right here .Can you come up to the stage?   Let me give you this.   Here you go.   Excellent.   Yes, take it back to your seat.   Thank you.   And I only have nine plates of pasta and I have to throw away the other eight.   I am sorry.   So that is two, four, six.   All right.   So one plate of pasta being eaten, eight plates of pasta in the trash.   Who thinks that was a good idea?   Yeah, no, but well, the one guy who is eating the pasta.   Excellent.   I actually heard gasps.   There was applause for pasta.   There was gasps for throwing pasta away.   And that is right.   Filling away food is a horrible idea.   And yet that is basically the relationship that all of us enter into every time we are   choosing to eat meat.   Because a chicken, as just one example, it takes nine calories into a chicken in the   form of soy and oats and wheat and whatever the food is that is fed to the chicken that   is turned into feed and fed to the chicken.   So it takes nine calories in to get one calorie back out.   I am guessing most of you, the horror you expressed at throwing away pasta, are concerned   about food waste.   And we should be concerned about food waste.   Of every 100 calories of food that is produced, we literally throw away 40 of those calories.   We throw away almost half of all of the food that is produced in the United States.   And yet food that is produced by funneling crops through chickens, it is actually 800   percent food waste.   For every 100 calories of chicken that we produce, and chicken is the most efficient   meat, for every 100 calories of chicken that we produce, we throw away 800 calories by   cycling it through the chicken.   That means eight times as much land, eight times as much water, eight times as much gasoline   to till the crops, eight times as much pesticide and herbicide dumped onto the crops.   And that is not all of it.   There are also multiple extra stages of production that are required.   If we are going to grow crops to feed them to animals so that we can eat animals.   You have to grow the crops and you ship them on a gas-guzzling pollution spewing vehicle   to a feed mill, and you operate the feed mill.   And then you ship the feed on a gas-guzzling pollution spewing vehicle to an industrial   farm, and you operate that factory farm, and then you ship the animals to the slaughterhouse,   and you operate the slaughterhouse.   It's multiple extra stages of gas-guzzling pollution spewing vehicles, and multiple   extra stages of energy-intensive and polluting factories.   This is not a great way to feed 9.7 billion people by 2050.   Let's face it, it's a terrible way to try to feed all of those people.   The United Nations a number of years ago, they crunched the numbers on all of this inefficiency   and all of this pollution.   They released a more than 400-page report called Live Stocks Long Shadow.   And in Live Stocks Long Shadow, they determined that whatever environmental issue you want   to look at, from the smallest and most local to the largest and most global, the inefficiencies   of animal agriculture are one of the top causes, everything from water pollution to soil   desertification to species loss to climate change.   On the issue of climate change specifically, the United Nations says that more climate   change is attributable to the global meat industry than to all of the plains and trains   and trucks and automobiles, all forms of transport combined, almost 15 percent.   On a per calorie basis, animal agriculture, chicken, which is the least climate change-inducing   meat, causes 40 times as much climate change per calorie of protein when compared to eating   legumes like soy or peas directly.   So what's the solution to the problems of industrial animal agriculture?   The Royal Institute of International Affairs, the foremost think tank in Europe, more commonly   referred to as Chatham House.   A few years back, they released a report about the climate impact of the meat industry.   And their suggestion was that the governments of the world educate their citizens about   the climate impact of the meat industry and encourage people to eat less meat.   And the Chinese government has done just that.   The Chinese government has released climate-based dietary guidelines and has said that it is   their goal to cut meat consumption per capita in China in half by educating their citizen   rate.   I admire the optimism of Chatham House and the Chinese.   They think they're going to educate people about the climate impact of food and everybody's   going to eat less meat.   But I think a more likely climate hero is Ben and Jerry's non-dairy ice cream.   I'm being facetious, sort of, but who here likes Ben and Jerry's?   Yeah, I think we have unanimity on Ben and Jerry's too.   It looks like as many people like Ben and Jerry's as like pasta.   And if you're like everybody else, you saw Ben and Jerry's and you thought Ben and Jerry's   is delicious, right?   If it were 20 bucks a pint, that would have figured in.   You would have thought Ben and Jerry's too expensive.   If it wasn't available in every grocery store, that probably would have occurred to you.   You would have thought, where can I get it?   And those are in every study that's been done.   Those are the three factors that really dictate consumer choice, taste, price, and convenience.   100% of people in the developed world factor taste, price, and convenience into their decisions   about what it is that they're going to eat.   Some people figure in health, that's a somewhat distant fourth.   None of you, when I flashed Ben and Jerry's up here and said, you know, do you like this?   None of you thought health food.   Half of Americans eat fast food every single week.   Whether it's going to KFC, because it's a health food, right?   It's delicious, it's convenient, and it's cheap.   So how do we apply the Ben and Jerry's trifecta, price, taste, and convenience?   How do we apply that to the harms of industrial animal agriculture?   And in answering that question, I'm going to tell you three brief stories about three   entrepreneurs who are doing precisely that.   The first one is this guy, Ethan Brown.   The year is 2009, and Ethan Brown, who is this bearer of a man, he looks more like a   college football player than he looks like a tree-hugging environmentalist.   But there Ethan is working on clean energy, and he's learned about the environmental   harm of industrial animal agriculture, and he wants to do something about it.   And it occurs to Ethan that meat is made of lipids, amino acids, minerals, and water.   Everything in animal-based meat also exists in plants.   So Ethan's brainstorm is plant-based meat.   And he forms a company called Beyond Meat.   He starts raising money.   He starts hiring food scientists, and chefs, and other culinary experts.   And after about three years, in 2012, he comes out with this, Beyond Meat Plant-based   Chicken.   Bill Gates tries this chicken, and not only does he invest in Beyond Meat, but he writes   a blog in which he says, what I just tasted was not just a clever meat substitute.   What I just tasted is the future of food.   So Ethan introduces a couple more products, and in 2016, his next masterpiece, the Beyond   Burger.   The Beyond Burger is a plant-based burger that tastes so meat-like, it's actually offered   in the meat case at Whole Foods, at Kroger, at Safeway, at Albertsons, at a bunch of   different grocery stores.   They also meet like that when Tyson Foods launched their first venture capital fund   in 2016, their very first investment was in Beyond Meat.   They have the largest meat producer in the United States buying in to plant-based meat.   All right, story number two, another guy named Brown, Pat Brown, Dr. Pat Brown, again,   it's 2009.   And Pat Brown is a tenured professor of biochemistry at Stanford University.   And he is extremely concerned about what he sees as an impending climate crisis.   So he has an 18-month sabbatical coming up, and he spends his entire sabbatical figuring   out what he personally can do to try to stave off the climate crisis.   And at the end of that 18 months in 2011, he comes to the same conclusion that Ethan   Brown came to, about a year before Ethan launches the Beyond Meat Chicken, he decides   that plant-based meat is the way to go.   As a biochemist, he knows everything in meat he can make with plants.   So he raises money, and he hires scientists, and he hires culinary experts.   And it takes him five years to launch the Impossible Burger.   But boy, is it worth it.   This thing is amazing.   It's so fantastic.   It's drawn investments from Lee Kashang, the richest guy in Asia, the Facebook co-founder,   Dustin Moskowitz, the venture capital funds, Google Ventures.   It's so fantastic that he actually launches this thing in she-shey restaurants all over   the country.   And the first restaurant to offer the Impossible Burger, and the first chef to champion it,   is Mommafuku and Chef David Chang.   Some of you may remember that about a decade ago, David Chang very noisily took all vegetarian   entrees off of all of his menus and all of his restaurants as sort of his personal protest   against vegetarians and vegetarianism.   If you can get David Chang excited about a plant-based burger, you can get anybody excited   about a plant-based burger.   And it's certainly the case that Eric Schmidt is excited.   Eric Schmidt is the former CEO of Google.   He's now the chair of the board of Google's parent company, Alphabet.   And Eric Schmidt a couple years ago, he was asked to reflect on six technological innovations   that he thinks will improve life for humanity by a factor of at least tenfold in the fairly   near future.   And he's a tech guy, so he picked mostly stuff that you might have predicted.   He picks 3D printers for infrastructure.   He picks watches that know you're sick before you do self-driving cars.   But the first thing that Eric Schmidt talks about is plant-based meat.   He sees plant-based meat as an answer to two of society's really big questions.   How do we feed 9.7 billion people by 2050?   And what do we do about climate change?   He calls plant-based meat nerds over cattle.   Alright.   Our third entrepreneur is a guy named Uma Valetti.   The year is 2005, and Uma Valetti is training on cardiology at the Mayo Clinic.   And he's studying regenerative medicine, and he's a vegetarian, and he thinks if we can   grow human muscle tissue, why can't we grow chicken muscle tissue or pig muscle tissue   or fish muscle tissue, why can't we apply the principles of regenerative medicine to   meat?   And he ruminates on this for about ten years, spends a lot of time studying it, a lot of   time talking about it.   He actually opens a lab to study this, where he's a tenured professor of cardiology at   the University of Minnesota Medical Center, and in 2015 he launches the world's first   clean meat company called Memphis Meats.   It's called clean meat as a nod to clean energy.   Clean energy is energy that's better for the environment.   Clean meat is meat that's better for the environment.   It's also just literally cleaner.   Since there is no slaughterhouse, there's no bacterial contamination, and since there's   no live animal, there's no antibiotics necessary, no other drugs, so no antibiotic or drug   residues.   And this is what clean meat production looks like at scale.   Sort of your friendly neighborhood, meat brewery.   So he launches this company in 2015, and within a couple of months he has the world's first   clean meat meatball.   So this meatball was grown from cells, no cows harmed.   And he does it for about 1% of the price of clean meat production just two years earlier.   And Valeti, like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, he attracts tech titans, Richard Branson   invests, Bill Gates invests, the venture capital firm DFJ, an early investor in Skype and   Twitter they invest, and then Cargill, which is one of the world's largest food conglomerates,   the largest privately held company in the United States, they also invest.   But it seems to me that we shouldn't be relying or shouldn't have to rely on the private sector.   We shouldn't have to rely on venture capital.   Plant-based meat and clean meat are the solution to some of the world's biggest problems.   Theyre the answer, or at least part of the answer.   So the US government spends $3 billion a year on agricultural research.   China spends even more.   Imagine if the governments of the world, if they set up clean meat and plant-based   meat research centers at all of the worlds great universities for tissue engineering   and plant biology.   You could solve these problems a heck of a lot more quickly.   But of course, people like Uma Valeti and Pat Brown and Ethan Brown, theyre not waiting.   And you all can be a part of it too.   If youre entrepreneurial-minded, think about your next venture being a plant-based meat   or a clean meat company.   If youre science-minded, especially if youre interested in plant biology or tissue engineering,   think about becoming the chief technology officer or senior scientist at one of these   companies.   If youre in high school or youre in college and you dont know what you want to do yet,   think about science.   Think about entrepreneurship.   They are awesome.   You can do a tremendous amount of good in the world and do very well for you and your   soon-to-be family.   But really, no matter what you bring to the table, you have the capacity to join one of   these plant-based meat or these clean meat companies, which are about to be a trillion-dollar   market sector.   I want to explain my enthusiasm by way of a quick historical analogy.   The year is 1898.   There are 175,000 horses on the streets of New York City.   Those horses are excreting 50,000 tons of horse manure every single month.   And the streets of New York City and all of the major cities, theyre covered in horse   manure, theyre plagued by flies, and horse carcasses are everywhere.   And so 1898, again, a historical finger snap go.   The worlds first urban planting conference is convened, and people from all of the great   cities come to New York City, and the only item on the agenda is what do we do about   all of the horse shit.   And they cant figure it out.   Sposed to be a week long after less than two days, everybody just goes home.   Dispondent.   Ten years later, 1908, Henry Ford introduces the Model T. And within four years, there   are more cars than horses on the streets of New York City, and horse-drawn carriages are   relegated to the status of tourist attraction.   How many people here at the end of these talks, how many people here are going to walk out   of this auditorium, and your primary mode of transportation is going to be horse and   buggy?   No, of course not, right?   That would be absurd.   I am absolutely convinced that in the not too distant future, just like that's absurd,   the idea of growing massive amounts of crops to funnel them through animals so that we   can eat meat will be seen as similarly absurd.   And the reason for that is that visionaries have understood that we can make meat from   plants, and we can grow meat without all of the inefficiencies and without all of the   pollution.   In other words, food innovation on the one hand, which is competing with industrial   animal agriculture on the basis of the factors that actually dictate consumer choice, price,   taste, and convenience.   So what youve got is youve got markets, and youve got food technology.   Theyre going to save the world, and you can be part of it.   Thank you.   We need to try."""
8,mp3,"So, data and analytics are dramatically changing our everyday lives, not just online, not   just in some distant future, but in the physical world and in very real and tangible ways.   I spent the past 11 years of my life as a geek at MIT working in big data labs that seek   to use data science to study the physical world and try to solve society's great problems.   The field of big data seeks to analyze massive pools of data using computational tools to   find patterns and trends.   Data can be a really extraordinary storyteller unveiling the hidden narratives of things in   our everyday lives that we never would have seen.   I find the personal stories of inanimate things brought to life to be extraordinarily compelling.   I want to highlight first two projects from my time at MIT that I think highlight this   phenomenon really well.   The first is called Trash Track.   And in this project, we sought to better understand the waste management system, to   answer the question, where's your trash go when you throw it away?   Your old coffee cup or that flip phone that you carried around in the early 2000s or   bagel or this morning's paper.   Where did these things go?   This data didn't exist, so we had to create it.   We answered and then visualized this question by installing small sensors into pieces of   trash and then throwing them into the waste system.   And what you're seeing here is the data.   Every line, every node that you see is a single piece of trash moving through the city of   Seattle and then across the state and then across the country as weeks and months go   by.   And it's important to visualize this data because none of you are probably sitting here thinking,   yeah, that looks right.   That's working like it should, right?   Because no.   What the data shows us is a highly inefficient system whose inherent brokenness, I don't   think we really would have seen had the sensors not done the journalism for us.   A second project that I'd have to highlight has to do with creating robots that dive   into sewers and sample wastewater.   I know that sewage kind of gets a bad rap, but it's actually kind of awesome because   it can tell us an incredible amount about the health of our communities.   This technology was spun out by a group called BioBot Analytics, who's creating a cutting   edge technology to turn our sewers into modern day health observatories.   Their goal is to study opioids within the sewage, to better understand consumption in   cities.   And this data is key because it really helps cities understand where people are using   how to allocate resource and the effectiveness of programming over time.   Once again, the technology that's built into this machine is pulling back the curtain   and showing us something about our cities that we never would have seen without it.   So it turns out, as we see, that big data is really everywhere, even in your toilet.   And so now that we've talked about trash and sewage, let's move on to food.   A year ago I left MIT to pursue a passion in food.   And in 2017 started a company with my husband called Family Dinner.   The goal of our company is to create community around local food and the people who grow   it.   To make this happen, we're using data analytics, automation, and technology to build a distributed   network of local farms and to make improvements on the food system.   So what we see here is that the broad techniques and the mission of what we're trying to do   is really not dissimilar from the work at the MIT labs.   Which brings us to a critical question.   Why exactly would someone leave a very promising career at one of the top urban science labs   in the world to drive carrots around in our mom's acura?   It's a great car.   Because I believe that the story of local food needs to be understood, told, and elevated.   And in many ways, I think that nerds like us are really uniquely poised to tell it.   So where are we starting?   That's our starting point.   The current national food system is optimized for one thing only.   And that's corporate profit.   And think about that.   The most compelling reason for food companies to exist is not to feed hungry people.   It's not to make delicious tasting food.   It's profit.   And that has detrimental effects at all levels of our food system.   The antibiotics and pesticides that are being put into our food are detrimental to our health.   Waste pressure is forcing small farms out of business.   In fact, a lot of the things that you think about farms no longer exist.   Farms don't look like farms.   They look like factories.   And at the end of the day, the quality of the food that we're eating really suffers   too.   A factory farm tomato may kind of look like a regular tomato.   Bright red exterior.   But when you bite into it, the taste and texture just leave you wanting.   And we know that perhaps the greatest tragedy in all of this is that between 30 and 40%   of this food is just wasted.   It's thrown away.   That is 1.6 billion tons.   I can't even wrap my head around that number.   1.6 billion tons.   That's 1.2 trillion dollars a year in wasted food.   That is the cost of on-demand eating and convenience and the broken food system.   Now where's this waste happening?   Where's all this waste coming from?   Well we know that it happens in the field when you don't pick the sexiest-looking potatoes.   We know that it happens in transit, at the warehouses, in the grocery stores, and finally   on our own kitchen counters when we determine that that spotty brown banana no longer looks   so yummy.   All that waste, all that effort.   It's just planted, grown, harvested, shipped, and then just thrown away.   We think that there has to be a better way.   And so how do we improve upon this?   How do we make a better system?   In order to do this, we understand that we need to eliminate waste in the food supply   chain.   We need to get data in the hands of farmers so that they can make better predictions so   they can kind of compete with the big guy.   And then finally we need to prize as a company quality and taste above everything so that   people really value the delicious food on their plates.   This we believe is the better system.   This is the better way.   And the path to that better way is paved with data.   To highlight all of this, I want to tell the tale of two tomatoes.   We'll talk about them one by one.   A tomato in itself contains a beautiful snapshot of everything you might want to know about   the life cycle of that fruit, where it was grown, what it was treated with, nutritional   value, miles traveled to get to your plate, CO2 emissions along the way.   All of that information, all those little chapters in one small fruit.   It's very exciting.   This is tomato number one.   This is the guy that you'll find in sub-shops, supermarkets, and fast food joints along the   world.   It's got a really long and complicated backstory.   It's been treated with a cocktail of a dozen pesticides, and it just traveled at least   1,600 miles to get to your house.   And the image here is green, because these tomatoes are picked when green and hard as   a rock.   And then they are gassed along the way so that when they arrive at the destination, they   look bright and shiny and red and ripe.   All of that effort, all of that agricultural innovation and technology to create a product   that is entirely without taste.   And onto the second tomato in our tail.   This is the local version of the fruit.   Its story is much, much shorter.   This guy was grown by Luke Mahoney and his family at Brookford Farm in Canterbury, New   Hampshire.   It's got a pretty boring backstory.   It was planted, sat in the sun, and then it was picked.   That's it.   Like you wouldn't want to...   Yeah, there's not much more to that.   And it traveled maybe 70 miles to get to your plate.   But the difference is dramatic.   I want you to think about the last time you ate a fresh summer tomato.   And I know we're all covered in our jackets, but think about it.   The last time you ate a tomato from the garden, it's warm from the sun, richly red.   Maybe it smells like dirt.   There's something nostalgic and almost magical in that experience.   The taste and the flavor are incomparable.   And we really don't have to travel super far to get it.   Now this story extends up the food chain from the fruits and the vegetables that are on   our plate to the animals and the animal products that we consume.   What goes into raising them, and more importantly, what doesn't go into raising them, is critically   important.   Luke and his family have 60 cows.   They use traditional methods.   They do it the old way.   Pasture raised, no hormones, no antibiotics, hay for days.   And what they're doing here is just treating cows like their cows, not like they're in   a science experiment.   He's raising animals the way that his grandfather and his grandfather would have.   And at the end, it's just better.   It's better for the animals.   It's better for the environment.   Luke is not optimizing for profit or price, but for taste and for humanity.   And what you're thinking is there's already a solution to this.   It's the farmer's markets, the ones that many of you visit and the ones that I really enjoy.   They are a wonderful but in many ways suboptimal solution.   For us as the consumers, it's kind of great, right?   You go, there's this beautiful bounty of food.   You get the warm and fuzzies for supporting a local farm.   And you get the experience of trying something new and trying diverse products.   And inevitably, there's some guy playing a ukulele somewhere in the background.   But for the farmers, this presents a lot of risk, right?   You wake up at four.   You pack your truck, you hire a team, you get to your stall, but you have no guarantees   that you're going to move your product that day.   There's too many variables in the wingland.   For example, the weather, which is just a little bit unpredictable here.   The weather is one of many X factors that determine whether or not a market will be worth it for   the farmers.   Every time they roll the dice.   And there's another option.   Here we're talking about CSAs, community-supported agriculture.   In this model, customers pay up front, bearing the financial risk for the farmers.   Grow what they can, and the customers enjoy that bounty.   This also has a couple issues.   It's great for the farmer, because they're ensuring that they'll sell what they buy.   But for us, we still have to go and pick up that share.   And we know that a lot of farms can't grow a huge diversity of products.   So sometimes you're stuck with a mountain of any one particular thing.   Maybe this has happened to some of you.   And what do you do with 25 pounds of rutabaga in the dead of winter?   I still don't know.   So back to the question.   How do we fix this?   What we're hoping to do and what we're hoping to build is just a better way to CSA.   And there are three core innovations that make this thing hum.   The first of which is a subscription-based e-commerce platform, which helps us create   a consistent demand for our farmers throughout the year.   The subscription part here is key.   Orders process weekly.   We've got kind of the same number of orders week to week.   Second, this means that if farmers can sell online, they're no longer limited to the   geography directly around their farm or to the number of markets that they can sell.   We've blown the doors off of that for them.   Second demand forecasting.   We're using analytics to allow ourselves to look into the future and forecast demand.   This lets farmers know how much to harvest in the near term, but also what's a plant going   forward.   If 200 orders process on Monday, then we buy to meet that exact demand.   200 heads of broccoli, 200 pieces of salmon, et cetera, et cetera.   This automation and ordering means that here we are eliminating the waste in the food system   that bothers us all so much, because we are ensuring that the supply meets the exact demand.   It also allows us to look into the future with the farmers and do crop planting.   If we can say to them in June of this year, I'm going to need 400 pounds of asparagus   and 500 pounds of berries every week.   They can plant that accordingly, knowing with confidence that they will sell everything   that they have grown.   Finally, we use a route optimization software to help us solve the problem of the traveling   salesman.   We get a fleet of workers to come in and help us go the last mile, bringing all these goodies   directly to your door.   What data science and a super capable, wonderful team, none of this would be possible.   Maybe you've seen that we've got some sort of fiery, passionate core beliefs.   Yes, we're trying to build a sustainable business, but our eye is not only on profit, it's on   building a better holistic system of food.   Here's what we value.   People first, we're trying to build community around food, the people who love it, and the   people who grow it.   We built this company to support small farms.   Zero waste.   We all hate wasting food.   It just feels wrong.   Even that weirdo banana that's been sitting around on your coffee table for too long.   And lastly, taste.   If it doesn't taste good, if it's not that like perfect summer tomato, why bother?   So what we've done is worked with all these local farms to bring their things in and   then to drop them directly at your door so that we're connecting you right to them and   making, again, a more holistic system.   This is our vision of the future.   To extend this model beyond Boston, beyond New England, and across the country, to create   a nationwide distributed network of local farms and to connect all these farmers with   the people like you who love their food.   We believe at the end of the day that really insisting on eating local food is a revolutionary   act.   And we invite you to join us, and who knows, you may even make some friends along the way.   Thank you very much.   "
9,mp3,"Imagine if every time you buy a sandwich, someone cuts a third of it off, throws it   in the trash, and then charges you full price for the remaining two-thirds.   How would you respond to that?   Would you accept it?   Would it be any different if you threw that third away yourself?   Now what if, instead of going into the trash, that third of your sandwich got fed to animals   instead?   Would that make things better?   Would you still buy the sandwich?   Imagine if the store knew that the sandwich wouldn't keep, so they gave you a 70% discount   on it.   Finding that information, would you still buy the sandwich?   If most of your answers were no, then I have some pretty disappointing news for you.   This is essentially how our food system operates on a daily basis.   A third of global food production is never eaten.   It's thrown away.   I'm Jessica, and I'm a founder of a FoodTech startup, but you don't need me to tell you   that food waste is a huge problem.   We can simply look at the numbers.   According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, 1.3 billion tons of food are   wasted each year.   Now just think about that number.   1.3 billion tons.   It's enough to feed every single person in China and in Europe.   And food waste has quite a significant climate impact.   In landfills, food generally decomposes into methane, a greenhouse gas that has more than   80 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide.   Food waste generates 3.3 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year.   An eliminating food waste would have the same effect as taking 35 million cars off the road.   Imagine if Canada were to get rid of all of their cars.   And this waste translates into massive financial losses, both for businesses and for individuals.   Each year, the industry spends over a trillion dollars producing food that is never consumed.   I think it's clear from these discussions that food waste is not only highly inefficient   in terms of resource use and distribution, it's also a huge environmental threat.   And it's extremely bad for the economy.   Food waste would allow us to feed an extra 2 billion people.   We would be able to entirely offset the carbon footprint of India.   And we would be able to recover the GDP of Mexico all in one go.   So that seems like a pretty good initiative, right?   But what are we actually doing to address this problem?   Well, the UN did what the UN does best and they created a sustainable development goal.   So SDG 12.3 aims to have global per capita food waste by 2030.   But does anybody know how we're actually progressing towards this goal?   I mean, how are we going to be able to say in 8 years time that we've actually achieved   this target?   What are the metrics that we should be looking at and where are they now?   Oh, turns out that there's a few kinks we haven't quite worked out yet, such as what   actually is food waste anyway?   One would think that after all of the G20s, the COP26s and the world economic forums that   we would have a clear and standardized definition.   But that's simply not the case.   The EU's definition differs from the USDA's definition, which differs from the UN's definition.   And these definitions leave a lot of room for questions, such as are ugly vegetables   considered food waste.   What about food waste that gets repurposed into something else?   And is food only considered waste if it's thrown away?   If we can't even agree on how to define food waste, how are we going to be able to work   towards reducing it?   So for simplicity's sake, let's go with the most commonly accepted definition of food   waste.   Food waste is food that is not eaten and thrown away.   And now that we have defined food waste, how are we actually resolving this problem?   Well, most of today's food waste solutions prevent food from being thrown away.   After all, that is the UN's definition of food waste.   Food waste is food that doesn't get consumed because it's discarded.   And today's food waste solutions can be found in a couple of different categories.   We have redistribution systems.   We have marketplaces where individuals can buy leftovers from businesses.   We have peer-to-peer marketplaces for unused food.   We had dynamic pricing tools.   We have expiring management systems.   And we have waste-tracking solutions.   But all of these solutions only prevent food from being thrown away.   What about food that gets redistributed and not thrown out?   That technically, as per our definition, is not food waste.   But we should ask ourselves, are we actually helping when perfectly edible food is given   to farmers as feed for animals?   Is that actually a desirable outcome?   Should a baker put in the resources, costs, and labor necessary to make artisanal sourdough   bread only to feed it to pigs?   I mean, pigs don't need sourdough bread.   In fact, they should be eating vegetables and fruits and grass.   So this is neither an optimal solution for the baker, nor is it for the pigs.   And in the process of all of this, we have generated half a kilo of CO2 producing every   loaf of bread that nobody wants.   So let's say that instead of giving his bread away, the baker decides to sell it on a platform   where individuals can buy his leftovers.   However, these platforms often profit off of the fact that food businesses regularly   overproduce and have waste that they need to get rid of at the end of the day.   They often charge a transaction fee for sales on the platform.   So now, not only does the baker lose out on getting a fair return for his bread, but   he actually has to pay someone else to take that bread off his hands, and he'll only   get a nominal amount in return.   So this isn't really an ideal solution for the baker.   But what about the buyers?   Do they win?   How many times have you bought a mystery bag of leftovers because you needed a sourdough   bread?   The truth is that most people on these platforms, they're looking for a bargain.   You're on there looking to score a deal.   You're on there because you can buy a lot of food for cheap.   You're not necessarily on there because you need that loaf of sourdough bread.   Because if you did, you probably would have gone to the store and you probably would have   paid full price.   So let me ask you, show of hands.   Don't be shy now.   How often have you bought a mystery bag of leftovers and got what you wanted?   How often have you bought a mystery bag of leftovers and were actually able to finish   everything in the bag?   Okay.   Because I've seen some businesses stuffing trash bags full of bread because they had   so much left over.   That's right.   Trash bags.   How am I supposed to finish a trash bag full of bread before it goes bad?   These businesses are now pushing their waste onto me.   What's genius is that they're actually paying a third party to redirect their waste problem   onto someone else after already having put in the resources and the cost necessary to   make all of this food.   So who wins here?   Do I win?   Sort of.   But the stress of having to find something to do with a trash bag full of bread may outweigh   the benefits of getting it cheap in the first place.   Does a baker win?   Not really.   And the environment definitely loses out on inefficient use of resources.   Unfortunately, many of today's food waste solutions simply encourage unnecessary purchasing.   How often have you bought pasta sauce that's about to expire because you actually needed   it?   And how many times have you bought something that's about to expire simply because it's   cheap?   And how often were you actually able to use that ingredient before it went bad?   I think it's clear from these discussions that the challenges related to food waste cannot   simply be solved in a vacuum.   They need to be resolved alongside challenges related to profitability, efficiency, and   true demand.   Yet most of today's food waste solutions fail to address the root cause of the problem.   These solutions are great when you already have leftovers, but they're merely addressing   symptoms of a much bigger issue.   And that's sub-optimal planning.   You have leftovers because you decided to make too much.   You have leftovers because you bought more than you actually needed.   And without addressing this core challenge, overproduction and the losses it represents   for businesses will remain the status quo.   Waste will continue to get pushed onto consumers and consumers will continue to waste their   money buying things that they don't actually end up eating.   A McKinsey study found that food waste generated at the end of the supply chain, for example,   in households, represents more than eight times the energy utilization as that generated far   earlier on the farm level.   This means that producing food, which is ready for consumption, is eight times as energy   intensive as simply producing the raw ingredients.   Think about where your bread comes from.   A farmer had to plant seeds, he had to grow wheat.   That needed to be harvested, milled, baked, packaged, and then distributed to your grocery   store.   That's when you buy it.   And that's the point that we're focusing most of our food waste efforts today.   However, it's highly inefficient to target food waste at the point where the food has   already reached the consumer.   Because at this point, we've already unnecessarily spent a massive amount of resources.   So we need to be addressing overproduction far earlier in the value chain.   What if we could shift our focus away from redistribution and towards prevention?   What if, instead of redirecting waste, we could focus on how we can actually prevent   leftovers in the first place?   We should stop focusing on merely reducing food waste.   It leads to sub-optimal outcomes, and the industry needs to move towards more holistic   and incisive solutions which actually benefit everyone along the value chain.   Imagine if we could create solutions which strengthen the entire system, solutions which   are advantageous for producers, retailers, consumers, and the environment.   What if we started focusing on food optimization in order to move forward?   We could use resources far more efficiently, and we could only produce what's really necessary.   Instead of encouraging overproduction, which translates the losses for small businesses,   we could find ways of supporting our neighborhood coffee shops, your local deli, that hole in   the wall that makes a world's best cronuts.   We could find solutions where these guys also win, and we can help them find that sweet spot   between underselling and overproducing, and if we really wanted to help them, we should   be paying full price.   Imagine if we, as consumers, only buy what we eat, and we actually ate everything that   we bought.   What if we were better at planning our meals and we always repurposed leftovers into new   dishes which are both interesting and delicious?   Only have we done all of these things.   And we truly say that we're addressing food waste in a way where everyone wins.   But I have some good news for you.   We're already starting to see preventative initiatives at every stage in the food value   chain.   We've seen an explosion in precision agriculture which uses data to help farmers produce more   with fewer resources.   And based coatings have been developed to extend the shelf life of avocados and citrus   fruits.   Exponential improvements have been made in cold chain technology which allows for far more   efficient storage and transportation of harvest produce.   Sensors are being used to track freshness levels on batches of produce so retailers   know which boxes of lettuce to open and put on the shelves first.   Data analytics are helping retailers and distributors optimize ordering and reduce waste and a plethora   of zero waste and meal planning tools have been developed on the consumer side.   And the best part is that contributing to food optimization is easy.   And you can start today.   So looking at your fridge, get creative with your leftovers.   If you buy something that's about to expire, build a whole meal around that.   And if you happen to get a trash bag full of bread, take it to a homeless shelter and share your bounty.   Thank you.I appreciate that.   "
10,mp3,"Our lives are defined by the way we see the world.   So let's reimagine, reimagine, and reimagine again.   Thank you all for being here tonight and I'm really grateful that you all get to see my talk today.   Now, before I start, I'd like to do a poll and it's going to be based on how many of you think that AI is helpful   and how many of you think that AI is harmful with AI referring to artificial intelligence.   How many of you think that artificial intelligence is helpful?   Okay, seems like a good amount of you.   How many of you think that artificial intelligence is harmful?   Okay.   And how many of you don't know what artificial intelligence is?   Well, in my talk today, I'm going to explore this question.   What is AI?   In my opinion, I believe that AI is one of the greatest inventions ever created.   It's a branch of computer science that programs machines to build off an original program, or in other words, learn.   Leading examples of AI in the world today include chatbots. Chatbots are computer programs that communicate to humans   and learn from conversations in the past.   Another example of AI is machine learning.   Machine learning is primarily used to diagnose diseases and problems in x-rays.   However, there has been some debate if AI is good for humanity or will hurt us in the long run.   One advantage of AI is that it is very versatile and can automate tasks.   However, one disadvantage of AI is that it may cause unemployment by taking over jobs, particularly repetitive ones   that humans have been known to do.   Another disadvantage of AI is that it has no original creativity.   We know that artificial intelligence can predict based on the past, but we have to wonder if it can truly innovate and improvise.   Perhaps, however, the best use of AI is to use it as a complementary tool to help humans solve problems such as   food waste and malnutrition.   Let's first start with malnutrition.   Malnutrition refers to deficiencies or excesses in food intake.   In my talk today, I'm going to focus on deficiencies of food.   Currently, one in every seven people are hungry and 150 million children between the ages 0 to 5 are stunted.   Stunning refers to being significantly short for one's age.   Undenutrition contributes to nearly one in two deaths for children from the ages 0 to 5 in the developing world.   This is a map of the prevalence of undernutrition.   As you can see, in areas such as Central Africa and South Asia, the amount of undernourished people is much greater than in other areas.   These problems of undernutrition and stunting are only going to become more severe as the population is predicted to swell   to 11 billion people by 2100 with much of that increase in poor nations.   One question that you're probably asking now is, how do we address undernutrition?   One solution is to make more food, but the other is to reduce the amount of food we waste.   What is food waste?   Food waste is the loss of food either by the producer, the retailer, or the consumer.   Nearly one third of all food produced today gets wasted.   This contributes to greenhouse gases and is inefficient because calories are not getting to those who need them most.   As you can see in this chart, food waste occurs in developed countries during the consumption phase, or when a consumer is consuming the food.   In developing countries, however, food waste occurs during the production and distribution phases, or when the food is being processed and made.   Food waste during the production and distribution phases occurs mainly due to some problems.   These problems include inadequate processing, insufficient infrastructure, and poor storage.   This is a bar graph showing the annual food waste by region per person in kilograms.   As you can see in more developed areas such as the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and some parts of Europe.   The food waste per consumer almost reaches 100 kilograms per person.   However, in more developing areas such as South and Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the amount of food waste per person drops to only 10 kilograms to 20 kilograms per person.   So, what is the solution?   How do we waste less food and help feed the hungry? I believe we can use artificial intelligence to address this issue.   The World's Food Network, or the WFN, is the solution I propose to bring to the table.   The World's Food Network would use AI for its first two goals, which are to minimize the amount of miles that food travels and to help plants grow more efficiently.   The last goal would not use AI, and that is to reward producers and consumers for not wasting food.   The last part of the World's Food Network's goal, or overall, is to connect local farmers to markets in their area.   The first part of the World's Food Network's job, as I said before, is to decrease the amount of food miles or miles that food has to travel from the consumer, from the producer to the consumer.   An AI algorithm could utilize information for distributors and retailers and find the closest and highest quality producer to them.   For producers, this AI algorithm will predict which foods will be accepted and which will be rejected by local organic producers in their area.   It will allow producers to contact managers to stores and, in turn, build trust in how the food is made and prepared.   The second part of the World's Food Network's job is to maximize the amount of food available.   An AI algorithm could help plants grow more efficiently.   This would happen because AI would monitor each plant and control each plant's environment.   It would also control the temperature of each plant and the amount of water given to each one.   This, in turn, will maximize each plant's growth.   The last part of the World's Food Network's job is to reward consumers, producers, and retailers for not wasting food.   You could reward points to consumers for not wasting food.   These points could be redeemed at local organic supermarkets in their area.   You could also reward points to people for volunteering at local food banks and food shelters.   In some areas such as Central America, farmers have enough land to grow food, they just don't have the resources to do so.   These points could be donated to poor farmers in their area and give poor farmers the resources they need to build a new life.   Humanity is persevered for thousands upon thousands of years.   We have joined together and broken apart.   Our morality drives us to do the right thing.   And whether we are filmmakers, scientists, activists, or students, we all strive to make the world around us a better place.   We all can make a change in the world, no matter how large or small.   All in all, the World Food Network is my idea for a better world.   "

1,mp4,"I'm going to talk a little bit about strategy and its relationship with technology.   We tend to think of business strategy as being a rather abstract body of essentially economic   thought, perhaps rather timeless.   I'm going to argue that in fact business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about   technology, but those assumptions are changing and in fact changing quite dramatically and   that therefore what that will drive us to is a different concept of what we mean by business   strategy.   Let me start if I may with a little bit of history.   The idea of strategy in business owes its origins to two intellectual giants, Bruce Henderson,   founder of BCG and Michael Porter, professor at Harvard Business School.   Henderson's central idea was what you might call the Napoleonic idea of concentrating   mass against weakness, of overwhelming the enemy.   What Henderson recognized was that in the business world there are many phenomena which   are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns, scale, experience.   The more you do of something disproportionately the better you get.   Therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order   to achieve competitive advantage and that was the first introduction of essentially a   military concept of strategy into the business world.   Porter agreed with that premise but he qualified it.   He pointed out correctly that that's all very well but businesses actually have multiple   steps to them.   They have different components.   Each of those components might be driven by a different kind of strategy.   A company or a business might actually be advantaged in some activities but disadvantaged   in others.   He formed the concept of the value chain, essentially the sequence of steps with which   a raw material becomes component, becomes assembled into a finished product and then   is distributed for example.   And he argued that advantage accrued to each of those components and that the advantage   of the whole was in some sense the sum or the average of that of its parts.   And this idea of the value chain was predicated on the recognition that what holds a business   together is transaction costs.   The essence you need to coordinate, organizations are more efficient at coordination than markets   very often and therefore the nature and role and boundaries of the corporation are defined   by transaction costs.   It was on those two ideas, Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience   and Porter's idea of the value chain encompassing heterogeneous elements that the whole edifice   of business strategy was subsequently erected.   Now what I'm going to argue is that those premises are in fact being invalidated.   First of all let's think about transaction costs.   There are really two components transaction costs.   One is about processing information and the other is about communication.   These are the economics of processing and communicating as they have evolved over a long   period of time.   As we all know from so many contexts they have been radically transformed since the days   when Porter and Henderson first formulated their theories.   In particular since the mid-90s communications cost have actually been falling even faster   than transaction costs which is why communication, the internet, has exploded in such a dramatic   fashion.   Now those falling transaction costs have profound consequences because if transaction costs are   the glue that hold value chains together and they are falling there is less to economize   on.   There is less need for vertically integrated organization and value chains at least can   break up.   They need not necessarily but they can.   In particular it then becomes possible for a competitor in one business to use their   position in one step of the value chain in order to penetrate or attack or disintermediate   to a competitor in another.   That is not just an abstract proposition.   There are many very specific stories of how that actually happened.   A poster child example was the encyclopedia business.   The encyclopedia business in the days of leather bound books was basically a distribution   business.   Most of the cost was the commission to the salesman.   The CD ROM and then the internet came along new technologies, made the distribution of   knowledge many orders of magnitude cheaper and the encyclopedia industry collapsed.   It is now of course a very familiar story.   This in fact more generally was the story of the first generation of the internet economy.   It was about falling transaction costs breaking up value chains and therefore allowing disintermediation   or what we call deconstruction.   One of the questions I was occasionally asked was what is going to replace the encyclopedia   when Britannica no longer has a business model.   It was a while before the answer became manifest.   Now of course we know what it is.   It is the Wikipedia.   What is special about the Wikipedia is not its distribution.   What is special about the Wikipedia is the way it is produced.   The Wikipedia of course is encyclopedia created by its users.   This in fact defines what you might call the second decade of the internet economy.   The decade in which the internet as a noun became the internet as a verb.   It became a set of conversations.   The era in which user generated content and social networks became the dominant phenomenon.   Now what that really meant in terms of the Porter Henderson framework was the collapse   of certain kinds of economies of scale.   It turned out that tens of thousands of autonomous individuals writing in encyclopedia could   do just as good a job and certainly a much cheaper job than professionals in a hierarchical   organization.   So basically what was happening was that one layer of this value chain was becoming fragmented   as individuals could take over where organizations were no longer needed.   But there is another question that obviously this graph poses which is okay we have gone   through two decades does anything distinguish the third.   And what I am going to argue is that indeed something does distinguish the third and it   maps exactly onto the kind of Porter Henderson logic that we have been talking about and   that is about data.   If we go back to around 2000 a lot of people were talking about the information revolution   and it was indeed true that the world stock of data was growing indeed growing quite fast   but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analogue.   We go forward to 2007 not only had the world stock of data exploded but there had been   this massive substitution of digital for analogue.   And more important even than that if you look more carefully at this graph what you observe   is that about a half of that digital data is information that has an IP address it is   on a server or it is on a PC.   But having an IP address means that it can be connected to any other data that has an   IP address.   It means it becomes possible to put together half of the world's knowledge in order to   see patterns in entirely new thing.   If we run the numbers forward to today it probably looks something like this we are not   really sure.   If we run the numbers forward to 2020 we of course have an exact number courtesy of IDC   is curious to the future is so much more predictable than the present.   And what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication in the stock of information that is connected   via an IP address.   Now if the number of connections that we can make is proportional to the number of pairs   of data points.   A hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data is a ten thousandfold multiplication   in the number of patterns that we can see in that data.   This just in the last ten or eleven years.   This I would submit is a sea change, a profound change in the economics of the world that   we live in.   The first human genome that of James Watson was mapped as the culmination of the human   genome project in the year 2000.   It took about two hundred million dollars and about ten years of work to map just one   person's genomic makeup.   Since then the costs of mapping the genome have come down.   In fact they come down in recent years very dramatically indeed to the point where the   cost is now below a thousand dollars and it's confidently predicted that by the year 2015   it will be below a hundred dollars.   A five or six order of magnitude drop in the cost of genomic mapping in just a fifteen year   period.   An extraordinary phenomenon.   Now in the days when mapping a genome costs millions or even tens of thousands it was   basically a research enterprise.   Scientists would gather some representative people and they would see patterns and they   try to make generalizations about human nature and disease from the abstract patterns they   find from these particular selected individuals.   But when the genome can be mapped for a hundred bucks, ninety nine dollars while you wait,   then what happens is it becomes retail.   It becomes a bubble, clinical.   You go to the doctor with the cold and if they are here she hasn't done it.   Already the first thing they do is map your genome.   At which point what they're now doing is not starting from some abstract knowledge of   genomic medicine and trying to work out how it applies to you but they're starting from   your particular genome.   Now think of the power of that.   Think of where that takes us when we can combine genomic data with clinical data, with data   about drug interactions with the kind of ambient data that devices like our phone and medical   sensors will increasingly be collected.   Think what happens when we collect all of that data and we can put it together in order   to find patterns we wouldn't see before.   This I would suggest perhaps it will take a while but this will drive a revolution in   medicine, fabulous.   Lots of people talk about this.   But there's one thing that doesn't get much attention.   How is that model of colossal sharing across all of those kinds of databases compatible   with the business models of institutions and organizations and corporations that are involved   in this business today?   If your business is based on proprietary data, if your competitive advantage is defined by   your data, how on earth is that company or is that society in fact going to achieve the   value that's implicit in the technology?   They can't.   So essentially what's happening here and genomics is merely one example of this is   that technology is driving the natural scaling of the activity beyond the institutional boundaries   within which we have been used to thinking about it and in particular beyond the institutional   boundaries in terms of which business strategy as a discipline is formulated.   The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated oligopolistic competition   among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving by one means or another from a   vertical structure to a horizontal one.   Why is that happening?   It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing.   The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together and   allows them to separate.   The polarization of scale economies towards the very small, small is beautiful, allows   for scalable communities to substitute for conventional corporate production.   The scaling in the opposite direction towards things like big data drive the structure of   business towards the creation of new kinds of institution that can achieve that scale.   But either way, a typically vertical structure gets driven to becoming more horizontal.   The logic isn't just about big data.   If we were to look for example at the telecommunications industry, you can tell the same story about   fiber optics.   If we look at the pharmaceutical industry or for that matter university research, you   can say exactly the same story about so-called big science.   And in the opposite direction, if we look say at the energy sector where all the talk   is about how households will be efficient producers of green energy and efficient   conservers of energy, that is in fact the reverse phenomenon.   That is the fragmentation of scale because the very small can substitute for the traditional   corporate scale.   Either way, what we are driven to is this horizontalization of the structure of industries.   And that implies fundamental changes in how we think about strategy.   It means for example that we need to think about strategy as a curation of these kinds   of horizontal structure, where things like business definition and even industry definition   are actually the outcomes of strategy, not something that the strategy presupposes.   Big means for example, we need to work out how to accommodate collaboration and competition   simultaneously.   Think about the genome.   We need to accommodate the very large and the very small simultaneously.   And we need industry structures that will accommodate very, very different motivations   from the amateur motivations of people in communities to maybe the social motivations   of infrastructure built by governments or for that matter cooperative institutions built   by companies that are otherwise competing because that is the only way that they can   get to scale.   These kinds of transformation render the traditional premises of business strategy obsolete.   They drive us into a completely new world.   They require us whether we are in the public sector or the private sector to think very   fundamentally differently about the structure of business and at last it makes strategy   interesting again.   Thank you.     "
2,mp4,"Every year, tons of millions of food are wasted globally.   We are motivated to explore the opportunities of using the modern big data and internet   of things, technologies to facilitate the food supply chain sustainability in general.   In the past three years, we have investigated several research questions in the food logistics   domain.   We studied the cross-purchase ability effect when different food products are stored and   transported together.   They create either positive negative effects on each other.   So it has never been studied before.   And then we investigate this effect and come up with genetic algorithms solutions.   And we also investigated some of the effects that has been long ignored in the food retail   industry.   For example, when food products are stored on a front-end shelf, they deteriorate faster   than when they are stored in the back room.   We also find that it's significant if we consider this effect.   Similar to data, combined with the real industrial data, we prove that big data and the emerging   technologies, including IoT, sensor network, can greatly improve the food preservation,   can greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of food logistics.   Today, most food supply chain practitioners base their management of the food logistics   on the classic perishable inventory management.   While we contribute to the classic perishable inventory management literature by introducing   a number of new concepts, including cross-periability, including the deterioration and deterioration   rate gaps from nodes to nodes.   And then we also propose novel data analytics tools to facilitate the optimization solution   finding of these new problems.   The research can be utilized by major grocery retailers, food wholesalers.   When various conditions, new conditions can be considered by utilizing the Internet of   Things and the artificial intelligence to assess network and alongside with artificial intelligence   to facilitate the food preservation as well as boost revenue and reduce cost."
3,mp4,"Human have evolved to be the most dominant species on the face of the Earth.  Over the time, as we have gained in our cognitive capabilities, we have also ended up developing  a lifestyle that makes us vulnerable for diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular  disorders.  You may want to blame it on your genes, on your friends or for that matter on your sedentary  work profiles, but your diet happens to be the most important contributing factors to  these diseases.  We humans have cooking as a very unique endeavor that seems to be contributing to the big brains  that we have, but ironically, at the same time, our food, our diet has also contributed  to the various epidemic of disorders that we see today.  Is it possible for us to use the same food for devising methods for improving health?  That's a question I want to ask.  Experts, having dwelling and finding ways by which food is actually interacting with our  body giving rise to various health-related effects.  The interaction between our body and the food is so complicated that there is no convergence  in terms of having clear results on that.  And therefore, you end up getting all kinds of conclusions which are rather contradictory.  Coffee is good for your health.  Well, not really.  Fish seems to be good for your health, but there are contradictory evidences also for  that.  Everything is good for you, think of taking a cup and there is another result says that  no, not really.  Reductionist approaches don't seem to have helped us much.  Therefore, I believe that taking data-centric and evidence-driven approach to the food is  the best way of leveraging food for better health.  With this idea, I would like to present you with our investigations of Indian cuisine,  for patterns and future directions which can be potentially used for using food as a medicine.  We started our studies by asking a very simple question.  Why do we eat what we eat?  What we eat seems to be coming from traditional dietary practices which are ingrained encoded  in terms of traditional recipes.  Therefore, the same question gets transformed into why we combine ingredients in our recipes,  the way we do.  Now, that's an interesting question to ask, isn't it?  One of the possible answers for this question is the food pairing hypothesis.  It says that we tend to use ingredients together in our recipes that are very similar to each  other.  This essentially means that we tend to blend the ingredients in a uniform manner.  To be able to investigate this particular question in the context of Indian cuisine,  we actually scraped extracted, compiled the data of recipes from across the regions of  India.  This data comprised of more than 2,500 recipes composed of close to 200 ingredients from various  ingredient categories such as vegetables, spices, dairy, nuts and seeds, etc.  Now the choice of an ingredient in the recipes happens because of the flavor of the ingredient.  And the flavor of the ingredient arises primarily because of the way we taste and smell them  through what are known as olfactory and gustatory molecular sensory mechanisms.  The pungency of the onion and the spiciness of the chili is because of the flavor that  it has got and giving rise to a variety, a spectrum of the flavors.  Therefore, we extracted for all these ingredients which are used in the Indian cuisine, the flavor  molecules using offline and online resources such as phenolaryl's handbook of flavor ingredients  and pup kem.  Now every ingredient is characterized with a bunch of flavor molecules that is representing  its unique taste and the flavor.  Having got handled on the data of recipes, ingredients and flavor molecules, now the food  pairing hypothesis becomes testable.  Food pairing is a quantifiable entity now.  Starting from all the recipes in the Indian cuisine, we dissected each of this recipe  into its constituent ingredients and further computed the food pairing.  This particular number tells us about the average number of shared molecules across all  pairs of ingredients in a given recipe.  And when averaged over all the recipes, it gives us a single number that quantifies what  is the essence of a given cuisine.  Thus, food pairing is an objective measure would try to capture the molecular incidence  of a given cuisine.  Similar to regional languages, cultures across the world have been evolving ways by which  recipes are developed in a different manner, variations in them, variations in which the  ingredients are composed in them.  So we ask this question about what happens in the case of a random cuisine, a cuisine  which does not have any influence of culture, climate and other influences.  Such a random cuisine will end up combining ingredients without any specific preferences.  Compared to such kind of a random cuisine, it has been shown that western cuisines such  as North American, Latin American, Eastern and Southern European cuisines tend to have  what is called as uniform food pairing.  This is the kind of pairing in which these recipes tend to use ingredients which are  similar in their flavor and the test.  Similarly to what has been observed so far, we found from our studies in the lab that  Indian cuisine is characterized with a contrasting food pairing.  This is a unique pattern that we have found in the case of Indian cuisine that could be  in fact characterizing the sense of the Indian cuisine.  Therefore we find that the Indian cuisine is rather unique, special in terms of blending  the way the ingredients are put in the recipes that we have.  And we also find that this pattern is rather consistent across all the regional cuisines  that we have studied, thereby in fact giving us the quintessential molecular nature of  the Indian cuisine.  What it means is that when you look at ingredient trace across all the recipes, you find that  with more and more similarity in the ingredients, we find that these ingredients are used less  and less frequently in the Indian recipes.  We wanted to also find what is the contribution of individual ingredient categories that I  mentioned to you about in this unique food pairing pattern.  So we did an experiment.  To find the importance of an ingredient category, we randomized the recipes one category at  a time.  For example, to find what is the importance of the vegetables, we took all the recipes  and randomized every vegetable, shuffled it completely by using any one of the vegetable  in the full vegetable basket.  And we did that we find that for all of these categories, the food pairing is hardly changing,  which means that these categories are not so relevant except for one particular category,  spice.  We find that if you randomly shuffle spices in Indian recipes, it tends to destroy the  food pairing pattern that it has got.  Chefs in fact suggest that such unique positioning of spices is important for the taste of the  recipe.  We further went ahead and ranked ingredients in terms of their relevance, importance for  contribution in the food pairing.  And we find that among the best ranked ingredients, majority of them are spices.  Given this, I am tempted to say that spice is the taste of India.  Although, given the fact that taste is a very subtle sensory matter, you should take my  suggestion and instruction with a pinch of salt.  Another discovery of unique characteristic flavor pairing pattern that is found in Indian  cuisine has been highlighted as an emerging technology by MIT technology review.  I believe that like knowing the rules of gravity allows us to predict eclipses as well as  to launch satellites into the space, knowing such culinary fingerprints patterns in the  cuisine should allow us to develop applications for food, nutrition and health.  Given the variety of ingredients that are available, the total number of recipes that  can be developed, that can be synthesized, is astronomically large.  So we are actually developing algorithms for designing new recipes.  Apart from that, there are various dimensions in which our research is taking us, such as  formulation of food beverage pairing, testing new hypothesis, looking for how food interacts  with our genome, as well as mining the patterns of food disease associations.  One of the most interesting directions in this area is that of personalized nutrition.  In this landmark study, researchers collected personal profiles of a large number of people,  lifestyle data such as data of gut micromicrobiums, blood test, questionnaires and habits, etc.  Along with this, they also changed one of the diet of all these people with a standardized  diet.  And by looking at both these data, they tried to correlate using a machine learning algorithm,  these features with that of post-meal increase of glucose levels, which is known to be directly  linked to the type 2 diabetes.  Using such a personalized nutrition predictor, the researchers could actually fairly accurately  predict for a new set of people the expected rise of glucose levels.  More importantly, they were able to use an intervention strategy by choosing a specific  diet to lower the levels of glucose post-meal.  Now that's an interesting study which can take us into the cure of the diabetes.  I know it sounds like science fiction, like a moonshot, but who believed in weather predictions  a few decades back?  Despite the fact that weather is a non-linear phenomena, with the availability of large  amount of data, computational and mathematical techniques, today we have been able to transform  meteorology into a believable science, at least for short term predictions.  I believe that the day is not too far when we will be able to use such data driven studies  and evidence driven studies to be able to come up with strategies by which we should  be able to use food as a medicine.  As a teenager, I was an aspiring astronomer and astrophysicist.  I saw this quote in IUKA, the Inter-Inversity Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Pune.  The discovery of a new dish confers more happiness on the humanity than the discovery of a new  star.  This was put up by this humble astronomers.  Still I have not been able to discover new stars by being an astronomer.  I hope that through my data driven studies, I should be able to discover new dishes, making  humanity happier and hopefully healthier.  Thank you."

If you have not been informed yet, please approach the counter out there and if you are going  to make a presentation on your laptops or notebooks, coordinate with the counter out  there and they will help you about how to go about the presentation.  There is another announcement.  You are kindly requested to ask in the counter outside.  With this, we start the next session of this morning's program.  It's been titled Unlocking Value from Data, Scenarios from Verticals.  A question that crops up can perspective analytics address FMCG growth of challenges.  To answer this question, I call upon Mr. Oryndam Shown, Global Brand Director, Unilever, Singapore.  A few words about Mr. Oryndam Shown.  Mr. Oryndam Shown is the Global Brand Director, Unilever.  He has been with Unilever for 12 years.  Previous to that, he has been associated with the India market research industry.  Within Unilever, he has spent about 8 years in practicing consumer and market insight for FMCG categories globally and about 4 years in exploring and landing new innovations  in alternate business models for disruptive growth in emerging countries.  Throughout his career, he has been an enthusiast of quantitative research including advanced,multivariate statistical approaches to solve for complex brand and business-related issues.  He has a great admirer of the amazing evolution of predictive analytics and big data applications over the last few years and is keen to apply them as a foundation for the contemporary marketing thinking in business.  Oryndam has worked across Europe, Southeast Asia and South Asia and is currently employed  with Unilever, Singapore.  I welcome Mr. Oryndam Shown to make the presentation.  Hi.  So, I am Arindam and I am actually Bengali from Calcutta.  So, it is coming back home for me.  And it is a great honor for me to be speaking among such luminaries.  I do not actually deserve all this kind of recognition which the individual actually  talked about me.  It is just a small thing that I am actually an enthusiast of big data and predictive analytics.  And I have been somehow connected through my profession of practicing insights in FMCG  and Unilever.  And it is an honor that the Data Science Foundation is actually approaching individuals like us  to talk among experts like you.  And I really feel acknowledged.  It is a privilege to be talking in front of you guys.  So, I will talk about the FMCG and I will talk about the basic product categories like  soap, shampoos and cleaners.  It is nothing like the smart cities which we have been hearing about till now.  So that is the thing.  So, it is about actually coming back to the ground in that context.  Hopefully, there would be some questions at the end of it.  I would like to receive all those questions and try to answer them as much as capacity  as I can.  I hope it is visible.  So, in our world, what is happening is we are going through a bit of a stagnation for  the last few years.  And so, this is, I am talking about the FMCG world.  And this is where the big question is.  As we see now, that there is a big desire for growth, especially among the multinational  corporations and the global corporations.  And what we desired in the last five years, that there would be amazing growth which will  come from the emerging countries.  And that will cover up further developed world stagnation.  However, what we have seen and you would see in the two graphs which is there towards your  left hand side.  Both in the, whether it is your up or it is like a back, what is happening is there is  a tremendous slowdown which is happening of the basic FMCG categories.  And there are various reasons, but one of the bigger reasons is that big multinational  corporations are not being able to innovate to the extent it is required for emerging  world, for the emerging world consumers.  Because what we actually do is we actually increase efficiency in by bringing in and rolling  out global products.  Yeah, that is how we do it.  And in the last two, three years, what we have seen across let us say, when we were  even, when, uh, graduates or doctors, what we are seeing is that the emerging world consumer  is quite different.  And if we just try to roll out the global products, it is not happening.  And that is probably one of the bigger reasons that why there is a stagnation in the FMCG  industry.  So it is one ask therefore to reverse that growth and therefore that is an opportunity.  Yeah.  So, the other thing which is increasingly dawning upon us that over a period of time, we have  built FMCG growth by inducing loyalty.  Yeah.  So currently what people use, we ask them to use more.  And as a result, they move from substitute products and come to branded products.  What is, uh, what is more and more, uh, coming out in the, uh, in the, there's a famous  book which is come out, which is called How Brands Grow, uh, by Byron Sharp.  And what it is saying is that growth, whether it's developed world or the emerging world  will only come from new customer acquisitions or new consumer, uh, who can become new users.  And as a result, uh, what we see is that the challenge which we have due to stagnation  in FMCG is actually compounded because what you now need is actually convert, uh, today's  emerging world's non-branded users to actually branded product users.  Yeah.  So that's an even bigger challenge.  And that has actually come through, uh, quite a lot of evidence is which you see towards  that chart in the right hand side, which says that all, uh, growth, uh, which has come in  the last, uh, whatever, 10, 15 years, uh, has been only made possible if there is a growth  in penetration.  And whoever has targeted such a loyalty or generally upgradation or benefit acquisitions,  those things haven't really worked.  So basically the, uh, it's back to the basics for marketing, uh, for us.  That is how do you find new people to actually use our products.  And if that happens, probably the stagnation which we see, uh, of FMCG, whether it's the  developed world or the emerging world, uh, will probably be reversed and will come back  to the growth curve.  So that's the bigger context in which, uh, I thought I will address this forum.  So, um, so it's, it's a bit cluttered, but, um, this, uh, the chart, uh, towards your  left hand side is a typical, uh, universe, uh, innovation, uh, development, uh, framework.  Yeah.  So obviously I've kept it small so I like it's not, uh, completely, uh, be read because  that's a bit confidential.  However, the point is that, uh, we, uh, we do a lot of researches, market researches.  Yeah.  So we actually, uh, while we developed products and propositions and communications, we actually  go out and, and survey people and do a lot of market researches.  And that's the way we try to see whether we can have winning propositions or winning  products or winning communications and as a result, uh, get new users and as a result,  get new growth.  That's the way we've done it.  However, uh, in the increasing world of evolving analytics, uh, one of the major things which  has come about in unity world and probably, uh, across other organizations is to actually  take big sums of market data and, uh, do modeling on those data.  As a result, which what we have now is a thing called MMM, which is which we call it as market  mix modeling.  However, that market mix modeling happens with actually the data which is, which, which,  it happens with the data vendor, innovations are launched in the market.  For example, all this market mix modeling is happening with, uh, you know, television  data or market share data or penetration data or loyalty data.  That is basically what is happening in the market post the launches of these innovations.  However, uh, if we have to really change the growth trajectory, that is actually, uh, you  know, get out from that stagnation, get to new users, get to new kinds of propositions  and new products and all that, what we desire is how can predictive analytics actually  inspire product development or inspire new product, new proposition, new communication  development rather than coming at the end and saying that how much of investment should  be there in, uh, let's say promotion or should be there in communication or should be there  in, uh, other kinds of stuff.  Yeah.  So that's more evaluative.  What we need analytics to address is how can we actually develop products for the emerging  countries to get back to the growth curve and to have new users.  Yeah.  So that's the big challenge.  So, uh, mine therefore request to all the experts sitting here is please help the FMCG  industry or us to actually, uh, get to the, get to, uh, the new growth, uh, which we  desire rather than only diagnosing the performance.  Yeah.  Uh, and that's why I built this, uh, part that is how can analytics be in the front end  of the funnel rather than analytics actually trying to measure the market and doing market  mix media modeling.  So, uh, so what we thought is, so, uh, of course we have 15 minutes time and I'll try  to.  So we in, in a FMCG basically we talk about the six P's, right?  The, uh, the proposition, the product, that price, promotion and place.  These are the six levers through which we try to, uh, deliver growth, deliver growth  consumption or whatever it is.  So, uh, while practicing insights and, uh, very recently innovations as well in uni-deward,  I have found that all these six levers can be addressed in a new fashion.  Yeah.  And I think that analytics can help in a big way, uh, to actually deliver this, especially  among these, uh, six levers.  So today I'll just talk about proposition, product and, uh, promotion and I'll try to  raise these questions and I'll leave to the forum to, uh, see what kind of brainstorming  is possible.  So first is proposition.  Proposition means basically, you know, concept and communication.  What you, what you tell to the consumer.  Yeah.  Uh, so, uh, what again the new contemporary marketing theories are saying is that proposition,  the key to growth, uh, for proposition is not about making cut through advertising which  you see always in TV, but to form long-term brand associations.  Yeah.  So, uh, what do long-term brand associations mean basically, uh, for example, uh, we have  a brand like Coca-Cola which stands for happiness and over a large 50 years, how can the brand  stand for happiness?  Yeah.  This stand for happiness and associations of happiness rather than saying how perfect  is my advertising which comes, uh, let's say next year.  Yeah.  So that's the thing.  This is now proven through psychology and neuroscience that the consumer, uh, purchase  happens much more, uh, uh, uh, profitably and sustainably if the consumer grows an association  of the brand rather than hoping that the consumer will purchase due to a great advertising on  TV which he has listened to or watched, uh, one month ago.  Yeah.  Uh, because that's not how brands work.  Uh, and that's proven in this book, uh, and so about 50 years of data of Aaron Bock Bar  Institute which is proven that.  So, uh, as a result, the new marketing order, uh, says that it's important that we forget  about the USP's, the unique selling propositions, but actually grow the relevant brand associations.  It's not about personalization through advertising, but it's about refreshing and building memory  structures.  Yeah.  So, uh, and as soon as you hear the memory structures, I'm sure you understand the long  lasting, uh, impressions which you feel a brand should create.  Uh, and this is one of the, uh, at one of the, uh, evidences which we have for one of our  global brands, Domestos in India.  It's, uh, it's called Domics, but, uh, overall Domestos actually running the same advertising  since about 2005 till 2010, what happens is that are, uh, the so called awareness index,  which is a great indicator for purchase, actually just, uh, quadruple.  They're just running the same advertising, which basically means that we didn't really  need a new news through advertising, but sustaining the kind of associations which we built through  the brand from 2005, mid 2010, actually quadruple down, uh, sales in the UK.  So this is a UK, uh, chart.  So basically it's, it's, it's that.  So, uh, how can analytics help?  Yeah.  Uh, and, uh, so one of our, one of my question is that let's say we have 10 years of brand  association data, yeah, 10 years of brand equity data and 10 years of, uh, sales and  purchase data.  Yeah.  So, uh, instead of going on measuring communication year after year, why can't analytics actually  come and help in terms of telling what are those brand associations of a particular  brand of universe and how can we just stick to them and actually make sure that therefore  our purchase and sales continue, uh, and new growth happens, yeah, or new customer  acquisitions happen.  So that's one of the, uh, uh, I think opportunities for analytics to address is to say what are  those long term associations of a particular brand, which will make it sustained for the  next hundred years.  And that's what big data, uh, next is about product.  Uh, what we are increasingly seeing and I, I suppose I alluded it in the first, uh,  few minutes.  Uh, one of the reasons why FMCG is stagnating even in the developing, uh, emerging countries,  including India is like many of our FMC, MNCs are actually not addressing the real problems  of the consumers in, for example, India or a China or a Brazil or a Mexico, yeah.  Uh, so the developed world has an idea of a problem, of a consumer problem and that is  where let's say 40, 50 years ago a global product has been formed and that is what we  are now trying to, through the same product we are trying to address the, uh, emerging  product, emerging world's, uh, consumers.  However, what we are not understanding is that the usage of the products in this ecosystem  is extremely different, yeah.  And I wanted to, uh, show it through a video here and, uh, can you just click on this,  uh, yeah, make it full, make it full, full view and sound.  Alright.  The global innovations is to hunt for those big and moist problems of the consumer.  For example, people who cook with LPG have just no increase in their dishes.  Billions of people in South Asia and Africa cook with wood or coal.  They end up having burnt on grease and even soot in their aluminium vessels.  They read abrasion to clean, they repurpose ash, laundry powder and polythene wrappers.  She would say, these problems are a given. It's the way I live.  I can manage with what I have.  So basically there's another one which is in the other part towards the left-hand side.  It says basically the one part in the context of toilets focuses on lime scale and germs.  Whereas the major consumer problem in the emerging countries is about Mallota.  Same with the dishwasher.  Indian's face a lot of soot and burnt on stains.  However, the global products address a thing called grease.  Which is more of a western world problem.  So these are some of the problems which we see as the gaps in the market.  As a result, global products which are designed with the knowledge of product drivers across the world need to be relooked into.  So towards the right-hand side, I have put that question actually saying that.  So those are the typical charts of product drivers which are there in the which we practice in FMCG.  However, what is happening, what we should do is to redraw the drivers to design for future products of the emerging world.  Now how can we do that?  Again, let's say we have 10 years of product test and technical tests data.  From the emerging countries, we have that.  So if somebody actually gets an access to it and actually tries to get insights into it.  And redraw the product drivers, we'll probably end up with products which are not the familiar products of the western world.  So that's the way to again we are thinking that as a result, we can come to new products which can again propel growth in the FMCG industry.  So the other one is of course like quite well known and this is the evolving world of media.  And the media consumption is extremely changing and it's extremely changing at a fast rate in countries like India and lots of emerging world countries.  There's overlapping media consumption which basically means while you watch TV, you also are accessing your mobile and Facebook and like Google search or whatever it is.  And on top, what you see is basically all the internet stuff which is happening, especially in countries like Nigeria and India.  It's all happening through the mobile.  So actually across countries and there is a USA over there as well, but India is the mobile percentage of the total internet traffic by country.  India is the second largest in the world now.  Just Nigeria is above it.  So what is happening is basically and you can see how even the flat screen TV and the video viewing is changing to something which is much more vertical through your mobile.  You can also see how actually hours per day of consumption of media consumption is increasing.  So it's not only about taking share from TV but getting on to different other media and the overall pie is also increasing.  So therefore what is happening is it's a very complex world of media consumption which is happening and media planners should actually therefore rise up to this occasion.  It's a brilliant opportunity to actually have cross media planning and actually identify the role of each media.  For example, TV must be still about appointment viewing but maybe mobile is for about reading familiar stories.  So how does a brand actually create assets which is not about only the 32nd advertising but is also about creating stories for a Facebook in which the brand is an enabler.  So therefore what is happening is if cross media data, single source data is actually available and which would be in large sums and which would be a dynamic kind of a data.  How can the analytics world actually change the way media planning is done and media investments is done today because lot of things are being done through assumptions and the traditional world assumptions of reach, awareness and trials.  So these are the three things which I thought I'll address.  So if you have any questions you can let me know.  We will address this first.  So you will find there is a KPMG trends actually study which has come out in 2015 only.  The numbers are quantified over there.  It's there.  So India's unique position is it is adding the most number of internet traffic through mobile and that is the highest in the country, the highest in the world.  So it is adding the most number of users.  So the growth rate is highest not in terms of absolute state.  So that's your bigger chance or the bigger chance to act on.  Yeah.  When I see the apparel market so apparel industries so there is a there is a a for to keep the low customers.  But how if you see different from an apparel industry where the penetration versus loyalty so it is a balanced order.  How do you visualize it?  So I keep it simple.  So basically loyalty is a market phenomenon or a brand phenomenon.  That is what it is.  So big brands will have X percentage of loyalty smaller brands will have X minus delta X kind of loyalty.  So the loyalty actually doesn't differ much.  What differs is penetration or the user base.  So increasingly what contemporary marketing is saying that even if it's like for apparels it's very important to get new users to this so called apparel brands.  So for example there is a great revolution which is happening within India with the sub-assagees of the world who's actually getting a lot of users back into Indian into the traditional Indian dresses.  So that's about creating the aspiration of Indian brands and there's another brand I know it's coming up now which is called Indian roots.  It's all about getting therefore new customer acquisitions through new benefit explorations.  So loyalty is something which people say is more of a brand marketing phenomenon and loyalty programs don't do much.  Thank you.  So with that I think we'll close it here and welcome the next speaker.  Thank you.             "
5,mp4,"An announcement first for the speakers, we are going to come up next.  If you have not been informed yet, please approach the counter out there and if you are going  to make a presentation on your laptops or notebooks, coordinate with the counter out  there and they will help you about how to go about the presentation.  There is another announcement.  You are kindly requested to ask in the counter outside.  With this, we start the next session of this morning's program.  It's been titled Unlocking Value from Data, Scenarios from Verticals.  A question that crops up can perspective analytics address FMCG growth of challenges.  To answer this question, I call upon Mr. Oryndam Shown, Global Brand Director, Unilever, Singapore.  A few words about Mr. Oryndam Shown.  Mr. Oryndam Shown is the Global Brand Director, Unilever.  He has been with Unilever for 12 years.  Previous to that, he has been associated with the India market research industry.  Within Unilever, he has spent about 8 years in practicing consumer and market insight for FMCG categories globally and about 4 years in exploring and landing new innovations  in alternate business models for disruptive growth in emerging countries.  Throughout his career, he has been an enthusiast of quantitative research including advanced,multivariate statistical approaches to solve for complex brand and business-related issues.  He has a great admirer of the amazing evolution of predictive analytics and big data applications over the last few years and is keen to apply them as a foundation for the contemporary marketing thinking in business.  Oryndam has worked across Europe, Southeast Asia and South Asia and is currently employed  with Unilever, Singapore.  I welcome Mr. Oryndam Shown to make the presentation.  Hi.  So, I am Arindam and I am actually Bengali from Calcutta.  So, it is coming back home for me.  And it is a great honor for me to be speaking among such luminaries.  I do not actually deserve all this kind of recognition which the individual actually  talked about me.  It is just a small thing that I am actually an enthusiast of big data and predictive analytics.  And I have been somehow connected through my profession of practicing insights in FMCG  and Unilever.  And it is an honor that the Data Science Foundation is actually approaching individuals like us  to talk among experts like you.  And I really feel acknowledged.  It is a privilege to be talking in front of you guys.  So, I will talk about the FMCG and I will talk about the basic product categories like  soap, shampoos and cleaners.  It is nothing like the smart cities which we have been hearing about till now.  So that is the thing.  So, it is about actually coming back to the ground in that context.  Hopefully, there would be some questions at the end of it.  I would like to receive all those questions and try to answer them as much as capacity  as I can.  I hope it is visible.  So, in our world, what is happening is we are going through a bit of a stagnation for  the last few years.  And so, this is, I am talking about the FMCG world.  And this is where the big question is.  As we see now, that there is a big desire for growth, especially among the multinational  corporations and the global corporations.  And what we desired in the last five years, that there would be amazing growth which will  come from the emerging countries.  And that will cover up further developed world stagnation.  However, what we have seen and you would see in the two graphs which is there towards your  left hand side.  Both in the, whether it is your up or it is like a back, what is happening is there is  a tremendous slowdown which is happening of the basic FMCG categories.  And there are various reasons, but one of the bigger reasons is that big multinational  corporations are not being able to innovate to the extent it is required for emerging  world, for the emerging world consumers.  Because what we actually do is we actually increase efficiency in by bringing in and rolling  out global products.  Yeah, that is how we do it.  And in the last two, three years, what we have seen across let us say, when we were  even, when, uh, graduates or doctors, what we are seeing is that the emerging world consumer  is quite different.  And if we just try to roll out the global products, it is not happening.  And that is probably one of the bigger reasons that why there is a stagnation in the FMCG  industry.  So it is one ask therefore to reverse that growth and therefore that is an opportunity.  Yeah.  So, the other thing which is increasingly dawning upon us that over a period of time, we have  built FMCG growth by inducing loyalty.  Yeah.  So currently what people use, we ask them to use more.  And as a result, they move from substitute products and come to branded products.  What is, uh, what is more and more, uh, coming out in the, uh, in the, there's a famous  book which is come out, which is called How Brands Grow, uh, by Byron Sharp.  And what it is saying is that growth, whether it's developed world or the emerging world  will only come from new customer acquisitions or new consumer, uh, who can become new users.  And as a result, uh, what we see is that the challenge which we have due to stagnation  in FMCG is actually compounded because what you now need is actually convert, uh, today's  emerging world's non-branded users to actually branded product users.  Yeah.  So that's an even bigger challenge.  And that has actually come through, uh, quite a lot of evidence is which you see towards  that chart in the right hand side, which says that all, uh, growth, uh, which has come in  the last, uh, whatever, 10, 15 years, uh, has been only made possible if there is a growth  in penetration.  And whoever has targeted such a loyalty or generally upgradation or benefit acquisitions,  those things haven't really worked.  So basically the, uh, it's back to the basics for marketing, uh, for us.  That is how do you find new people to actually use our products.  And if that happens, probably the stagnation which we see, uh, of FMCG, whether it's the  developed world or the emerging world, uh, will probably be reversed and will come back  to the growth curve.  So that's the bigger context in which, uh, I thought I will address this forum.  So, um, so it's, it's a bit cluttered, but, um, this, uh, the chart, uh, towards your  left hand side is a typical, uh, universe, uh, innovation, uh, development, uh, framework.  Yeah.  So obviously I've kept it small so I like it's not, uh, completely, uh, be read because  that's a bit confidential.  However, the point is that, uh, we, uh, we do a lot of researches, market researches.  Yeah.  So we actually, uh, while we developed products and propositions and communications, we actually  go out and, and survey people and do a lot of market researches.  And that's the way we try to see whether we can have winning propositions or winning  products or winning communications and as a result, uh, get new users and as a result,  get new growth.  That's the way we've done it.  However, uh, in the increasing world of evolving analytics, uh, one of the major things which  has come about in unity world and probably, uh, across other organizations is to actually  take big sums of market data and, uh, do modeling on those data.  As a result, which what we have now is a thing called MMM, which is which we call it as market  mix modeling.  However, that market mix modeling happens with actually the data which is, which, which,  it happens with the data vendor, innovations are launched in the market.  For example, all this market mix modeling is happening with, uh, you know, television  data or market share data or penetration data or loyalty data.  That is basically what is happening in the market post the launches of these innovations.  However, uh, if we have to really change the growth trajectory, that is actually, uh, you  know, get out from that stagnation, get to new users, get to new kinds of propositions  and new products and all that, what we desire is how can predictive analytics actually  inspire product development or inspire new product, new proposition, new communication  development rather than coming at the end and saying that how much of investment should  be there in, uh, let's say promotion or should be there in communication or should be there  in, uh, other kinds of stuff.  Yeah.  So that's more evaluative.  What we need analytics to address is how can we actually develop products for the emerging  countries to get back to the growth curve and to have new users.  Yeah.  So that's the big challenge.  So, uh, mine therefore request to all the experts sitting here is please help the FMCG  industry or us to actually, uh, get to the, get to, uh, the new growth, uh, which we  desire rather than only diagnosing the performance.  Yeah.  Uh, and that's why I built this, uh, part that is how can analytics be in the front end  of the funnel rather than analytics actually trying to measure the market and doing market  mix media modeling.  So, uh, so what we thought is, so, uh, of course we have 15 minutes time and I'll try  to.  So we in, in a FMCG basically we talk about the six P's, right?  The, uh, the proposition, the product, that price, promotion and place.  These are the six levers through which we try to, uh, deliver growth, deliver growth  consumption or whatever it is.  So, uh, while practicing insights and, uh, very recently innovations as well in uni-deward,  I have found that all these six levers can be addressed in a new fashion.  Yeah.  And I think that analytics can help in a big way, uh, to actually deliver this, especially  among these, uh, six levers.  So today I'll just talk about proposition, product and, uh, promotion and I'll try to  raise these questions and I'll leave to the forum to, uh, see what kind of brainstorming  is possible.  So first is proposition.  Proposition means basically, you know, concept and communication.  What you, what you tell to the consumer.  Yeah.  Uh, so, uh, what again the new contemporary marketing theories are saying is that proposition,  the key to growth, uh, for proposition is not about making cut through advertising which  you see always in TV, but to form long-term brand associations.  Yeah.  So, uh, what do long-term brand associations mean basically, uh, for example, uh, we have  a brand like Coca-Cola which stands for happiness and over a large 50 years, how can the brand  stand for happiness?  Yeah.  This stand for happiness and associations of happiness rather than saying how perfect  is my advertising which comes, uh, let's say next year.  Yeah.  So that's the thing.  This is now proven through psychology and neuroscience that the consumer, uh, purchase  happens much more, uh, uh, uh, profitably and sustainably if the consumer grows an association  of the brand rather than hoping that the consumer will purchase due to a great advertising on  TV which he has listened to or watched, uh, one month ago.  Yeah.  Uh, because that's not how brands work.  Uh, and that's proven in this book, uh, and so about 50 years of data of Aaron Bock Bar  Institute which is proven that.  So, uh, as a result, the new marketing order, uh, says that it's important that we forget  about the USP's, the unique selling propositions, but actually grow the relevant brand associations.  It's not about personalization through advertising, but it's about refreshing and building memory  structures.  Yeah.  So, uh, and as soon as you hear the memory structures, I'm sure you understand the long  lasting, uh, impressions which you feel a brand should create.  Uh, and this is one of the, uh, at one of the, uh, evidences which we have for one of our  global brands, Domestos in India.  It's, uh, it's called Domics, but, uh, overall Domestos actually running the same advertising  since about 2005 till 2010, what happens is that are, uh, the so called awareness index,  which is a great indicator for purchase, actually just, uh, quadruple.  They're just running the same advertising, which basically means that we didn't really  need a new news through advertising, but sustaining the kind of associations which we built through  the brand from 2005, mid 2010, actually quadruple down, uh, sales in the UK.  So this is a UK, uh, chart.  So basically it's, it's, it's that.  So, uh, how can analytics help?  Yeah.  Uh, and, uh, so one of our, one of my question is that let's say we have 10 years of brand  association data, yeah, 10 years of brand equity data and 10 years of, uh, sales and  purchase data.  Yeah.  So, uh, instead of going on measuring communication year after year, why can't analytics actually  come and help in terms of telling what are those brand associations of a particular  brand of universe and how can we just stick to them and actually make sure that therefore  our purchase and sales continue, uh, and new growth happens, yeah, or new customer  acquisitions happen.  So that's one of the, uh, uh, I think opportunities for analytics to address is to say what are  those long term associations of a particular brand, which will make it sustained for the  next hundred years.  And that's what big data, uh, next is about product.  Uh, what we are increasingly seeing and I, I suppose I alluded it in the first, uh,  few minutes.  Uh, one of the reasons why FMCG is stagnating even in the developing, uh, emerging countries,  including India is like many of our FMC, MNCs are actually not addressing the real problems  of the consumers in, for example, India or a China or a Brazil or a Mexico, yeah.  Uh, so the developed world has an idea of a problem, of a consumer problem and that is  where let's say 40, 50 years ago a global product has been formed and that is what we  are now trying to, through the same product we are trying to address the, uh, emerging  product, emerging world's, uh, consumers.  However, what we are not understanding is that the usage of the products in this ecosystem  is extremely different, yeah.  And I wanted to, uh, show it through a video here and, uh, can you just click on this,  uh, yeah, make it full, make it full, full view and sound.  Alright.  The global innovations is to hunt for those big and moist problems of the consumer.  For example, people who cook with LPG have just no increase in their dishes.  Billions of people in South Asia and Africa cook with wood or coal.  They end up having burnt on grease and even soot in their aluminium vessels.  They read abrasion to clean, they repurpose ash, laundry powder and polythene wrappers.  She would say, these problems are a given. It's the way I live.  I can manage with what I have.  So basically there's another one which is in the other part towards the left-hand side.  It says basically the one part in the context of toilets focuses on lime scale and germs.

So towards the right-hand side, I have put that question actually saying that.  So those are the typical charts of product drivers which are there in the which we practice in FMCG.  However, what is happening, what we should do is to redraw the drivers to design for future products of the emerging world.  Now how can we do that?  Again, let's say we have 10 years of product test and technical tests data.  From the emerging countries, we have that.  So if somebody actually gets an access to it and actually tries to get insights into it.  And redraw the product drivers, we'll probably end up with products which are not the familiar products of the western world.  So that's the way to again we are thinking that as a result, we can come to new products which can again propel growth in the FMCG industry.  So the other one is of course like quite well known and this is the evolving world of media.  And the media consumption is extremely changing and it's extremely changing at a fast rate in countries like India and lots of emerging world countries.  There's overlapping media consumption which basically means while you watch TV, you also are accessing your mobile and Facebook and like Google search or whatever it is.

How can the analytics world actually change the way media planning is done and media investments is done today because lot of things are being done through assumptions and the traditional world assumptions of reach, awareness and trials.  So these are the three things which I thought I'll address.  So if you have any questions you can let me know.  We will address this first.  So you will find there is a KPMG trends actually study which has come out in 2015 only.  The numbers are quantified over there.  It's there.  So India's unique position is it is adding the most number of internet traffic through mobile and that is the highest in the country, the highest in the world.  So it is adding the most number of users.  So the growth rate is highest not in terms of absolute state.  So that's your bigger chance or the bigger chance to act on.  Yeah.  When I see the apparel market so apparel industries so there is a there is a a for to keep the low customers.  But how if you see different from an apparel industry where the penetration versus loyalty so it is a balanced order.  How do you visualize it?  So I keep it simple.  So basically loyalty is a market phenomenon or a brand phenomenon.  That is what it is.  So big brands will have X percentage of loyalty smaller brands will have X minus delta X kind of loyalty.  So the loyalty actually doesn't differ much.  What differs is penetration or the user base.  So increasingly what contemporary marketing is saying that even if it's like for apparels it's very important to get new users to this so called apparel brands.  So for example there is a great revolution which is happening within India with the sub-assagees of the world who's actually getting a lot of users back into Indian into the traditional Indian dresses.  So that's about creating the aspiration of Indian brands and there's another brand I know it's coming up now which is called Indian roots.  It's all about getting therefore new customer acquisitions through new benefit explorations.  So loyalty is something which people say is more of a brand marketing phenomenon and loyalty programs don't do much.  Thank you.  So with that I think we'll close it here and welcome the next speaker.  Thank you.             "
6,mp4,"WHER Dennis  So I vividly recall when I was a child asking my mammum, this question, where would I be let's go  and she responded  ki, utgangaji me jata hai,  vi bi long to ala paad.  And me being a curious child,  asked a next question to her.  And that was, from where does it go from Gangaji?  And she said, it goes into the sea.  Sadly, she was correct.  And here I am, asking the same question  to individuals, to the communities  that where is your waste going?  And they are oblivious.  They are indifferent of the fact that  about 80% of their waste is ending up in illegal landfills.  It is illegally burned and it is  ending up in the water bodies.  This is a video, which I clicked  on my visit to Rishikesh last month.  My initial learnings about waste management  happened during my seizure in France,  when I was observing the residents  segregating their waste intelligently.  I would observe their waste storage areas  were so well managed, they were so well kept.  And I would see their collection vehicles  coming on schedule every day.  And I brought back all that with me  when I moved back to India.  And I later decided to dive into waste  where I learned the nitty gritty's  and the ground level realities  of what is ailing waste management sector in our country.  That led on to conceptualize  pro-waste concepts.  It is a very non-classic model of waste management  where we are educating, we are empowering  and we are enabling institutions, organizations,  communities and universities to implement  and execute waste management processes  on their campuses so that their waste  is not sent off to the landfills.  And they can convert their waste into resource.  So what's ailing the waste management in our country?  What are the main factors that we are not able  to have pleasant scenario as we would all love to see?  So let us visualize our waste as this huge elephant.  And then there are stakeholders.  So the stakeholders may be seen as  the five blind men on the elephant trying to solve the waste issue.  So the first stakeholder may be the policy makers.  They are the ones who have written the waste management laws.  It's done very, very clearly.  The second stakeholders are the municipalities and the contractors.  They are responsible for implementing these laws  at the ground level.  And then we have generators of waste,  who are us and we are just consuming  and consuming and generating waste every day.  The technology providers, they are responsible  who are helping us to dispose of our waste safely  and then of course, such a far-at-mission.  So what's happening?  Why are we unable to do what we're supposed to do?  We all are working in silos and we are always blaming each other.  And the result is that even if we are spending  crores of rupees as budgets of solid waste management,  most of the money is just spent for transporting  the waste to the landfills, for transporting the waste  from our cities to the dumpyards or to the landfills  which are far-off from the cities.  And we know there are some infamous landfills in our country.  So it's high time that we move, we shift our gears  from the three original hours,  reduce, reuse, recycle and move on to rethink,  redefine and redesign waste.  So what is the rethink waste?  Let us understand that we need to rethink our consumption patterns.  We have to rethink and change our consumption to eco-friendly products  which we use in our day-to-day lives.  We have to rethink when we bin our waste,  we have to rethink the waste categories  and where our waste will go.  The next is redefine waste.  Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen that cleaning and waste management  are absolutely two different concepts.  Just brooming your waste and collecting your waste  from the bins and taking it out of your site is just cleaning.  That doesn't mean that you are handling your waste efficiently.  Most of the institutions and campuses where I have done assessments,  we've seen that they are lined with beautiful bins.  They have the best of infrastructure.  They have the big strength of housekeeping team  who are responsible for cleaning their campuses.  But what happens?  They are just cleaning, but they are not doing waste management.  They are spending a lot of money every day to take out their waste  from their premises to their dumpers.  But what is waste management?  It is when you take care of your waste from the point of source  it is generated till it is safely disposed of,  which is not going to cause pollution.  At the point where all categories of waste will be generated,  it can be organic waste, paper plastic, biomedical,  garden waste, e-waste, it is handled efficiently by the housekeeping team.  And then you store it, you transport it,  and then there is technology for safe disposal of all categories of waste.  That is called waste management.  We have been seeing, because of such a par with mission or whatever,  there will be a lot of events which have been happening  where we all start cleaning and grooming.  The grooming business has become quite huge and a lot of events around it.  But let us understand that, yes, such a par with mission has brought up the subject in the forefront,  but we have to go beyond it.  It says, one is not enough, we have to take 100 more steps towards such a  hierarchy or understand where our waste is going to.  We cannot send off waste out of our sight and say that we have done waste management.  We cannot afford to clean anymore, we cannot afford to just broom our waste out of the eyesight anymore.  And then comes redesigning waste.  We have to understand that we have to redesign our bin systems.  That means that the simple colour-coded bin where you can place it anywhere  is not going to solve the purpose.  The bin system has to be planned as per the facilities where the categories of the waste will be generated.  For example, if you put a normal 3-pin system in a large canteen, it won't work.  Because in a mess or in a canteen, there will be much more higher quantum of organic waste.  For example, you would have seen the 3-pin system at the airports.  And when you peep into it, you will see that in all the bins, the categories of waste are same.  That doesn't work.  Why?  So we have to redesign.  If we go to a hospital, there is a separate, totally different laws of handling biomedical waste.  A basic 3-pin system is not going to work there.  You need to have the proper legal colour-coded bins in any medical centre.  Or if you go to a hospital where students are residing, you have to have a bin system which has proper signages.  Let me tell you that the awareness gap is so huge in a society that just putting bins everywhere is not at all working.  We have been working with various institutions, organisations and education does not ensure that they will use the correct bin whenever they have to bin their waste.  So this is a huge gap.  The bin system has to be planned along with proper signages and messages on it.  We have set up bin system even to collect human hair in one of the institutions.  And I am very sad to say that in that bin where we have clearly written that just put your hair inside,  we find wrappers of chips, we find food peels and what not into that bin.  So this is the kind of ground leveled realities which we are facing.  So it is very important to redesign your bin system.  So that it encourages the people to segregate their waste at source.  It facilitates the generators of waste to segregate their waste at source.  Here I would like to pinpoint that segregation at source is primary.  It doesn't come secondary after collection of waste.  That is the mistake India is doing.  We say that I am going to give my waste and the Kachrawala or the people who pick up waste are going to segregate it.  No, that doesn't happen.  The segregation of waste at source is the key.  So at homes, in offices, in institutions, everywhere the bin system has to be put in such a way that it facilitates segregation at source by the generators of waste.  And not by the collectors of waste.  Then comes waste collectors.  We have to redesign our waste collection processes which are defined very well,  which ensure that all categories of waste which are generated at various facilities on any campus or institute will be collected separately.  Normally we tend to see if the generators of waste are segregating their waste,  the waste collection vehicle will come and dump everything into it.  It is a very commonly practiced, it is happening which we get to here.  The reason being they don't have proper infrastructure, the reason being they are not well educated, the reason being they are not facilitated with proper bins or colored coated bins.  To handle segregated waste efficiently.  So a transportation system of waste, it can be primary transportation that is the first thing.  From primary transportation waste has to be taken to storage areas.  The storage areas of waste have to be well defined.  There has to be a waste storage area for paper plastic, there has to be a waste storage area for biomedical waste, there has to be a waste storage area for electronic waste.  There has to be a composting yard where you can take your organic waste.  So ladies and gentlemen, please understand that once you segregate your waste and your infrastructure or the processes are not properly designed,  properly designed to handle that segregated waste, you are going to lose everything, whatever hard work you have done.  And then in the end, it is design system for handling the safe disposal of waste.  Means solutions and technology, a proper technology that will suit your categories and characteristics of waste that is generated at your premises.  You need to have combination of composting, biogas, you have to have vendors who will do proper recycling, you will have to have vendors who will do scientific incineration for you.  That has to be designed properly. You cannot give all your waste to one vendor and just forget it and assume that he will take care of the waste.  So ladies and gentlemen, this is a call to action to move beyond recycle, reuse and reduce waste and adopt the three hours, the new three hours, the rethink, redefine and redesign waste.  Let us stop the set of cleaning and tread on to create a future without landfills.  Thank you so much. "
7,mp4,"I am sure all of us are aware that COJ emissions are leading to the climate change that is  happening all around us.  Almost all of us are affected in some way or the other.  We read about climate change as headlines, very regularly in newspapers.  It is affecting our travel schedules.  It is affecting our grocery bills because of vast devastation in agricultural output,  because of untimey rains or because of no rains, drought or excessive rains.  And somehow we do not take any action against it.  Did you know that the built environment, the infrastructure that we build contributes to  40% of all the CO2 emissions and therefore it has a very, very big impact on climate change.  In India our buildings consume 30% of all the electricity and 50% of all our energy.  Buildings once built last for 50 to 100 years.  So if designed wrongly or inefficiently, we will pay the price for it for the next 50 to  100 years.  It is high time that all of us engage in our decision making, right?  The next time we buy a house or we rent one or we give specifications for a built suit  building that we engage with our designers, with the developers in these conversations  where we specify the efficiency for energy, water and waste, right?  We should use our collective buying power to drive change at a massive scale.  One such company, one such company Infosys decided they will really be unreasonable and  reduce their carbon footprint by a factor of two.  Infosys 10 years ago was adding 20,000 new employees per year and they were adding 20  to 2 million square feet of new built space every year and they realized the impact of  their built environment on the climate change.  So what do they do first?  They set up an extensive monitoring system.  They metered and measured every building of Infosys.  They also started sub-metering and measuring all the major equipments, right?  And as a result of this rich data that they were gathering, they realized how energy was  being wasted at nights and how energy was spent in machines all around their campuses.  They collected this huge data set and created a set of goals for their consultants, for  their new projects.  Remember, they were adding 20,000 new employees and 2 million new square feet every year.  So what are the kind of goals, right?  And why it's not necessarily to be unreasonable, right?  So they took on goals saying that the heat load coming from a facade should reduce by  a factor of four, right?  The lighting use should come down by a factor of four.  Now you might wonder that these glass buildings that they were designing, why do they need  so much lighting?  Right, but it was causing so much glare that people put the blinds down and they had to  use artificial lights all the time, right?  Motors, they had documented that the motors were consuming maximum amount of energy at  Infosys and the highest amount of energy was in HVAC systems.  And so for both of them, they had a factor to reduction target.  Now, of course, when they socialize this with their consultants, the first reaction was,  I mean, this is impossible.  Are you suggesting that we are designing such poor buildings that you can do a factor  four, factor two kind of reduction?  And what Infosys did is because they thought that these guys are not taking them seriously,  decided to link their fees with the performance criteria.  So if you don't deliver on these performance numbers, we won't pay your fees.  At that point, everybody woke up and started taking it very, very seriously.  And were they successful?  Well, let's see.  So buildings which were very high tech looking, but very uncomfortable for the occupants  inside suddenly changed, right?  The window wall ratio from being 100% glass went down to 40 to 30%, right?  Architects started specifying insulation on our buildings.  Earlier it was thought that insulation was only necessary for poor climates.  Because insulation works both ways, right?  It doesn't let the heat come in.  And so what they saw is they started using super windows.  Now windows and glass, let's trap heat, right?  And so you have to use a very judiciously, especially in a warm and tropical climate  like India.  And there was a dramatic change.  The heat gain into these buildings came down from four watts a square foot to 0.5 watts  a square foot.  That's a 8x reduction, which was possible only because they stood the ground and started  demanding very unreasonable goals.  But this was very simple to achieve.  It wasn't unreasonable in hindsight, right?  Next the goal was that how do you reduce your lighting energy by 4x, right?  And so what was happening is that these deep, very deep buildings started becoming very  skinny.  And architects were very innovative.  There were a lot of research, there were a lot of simulation and they realized that  if they can reduce the floor plan of each wing to a maximum of 16 meters or 50 feet,  they could ensure that 90% of the floor space was completely dealt.  Now if you sit in a daily environment, you know, it really helps you and it can actually  increase 45 to 50 minutes of additional sleep during a day, in the nights, sorry.  So designing such buildings meant that, you know, now you are exposed to data and did  have to use electricity in the daytime, right?  And additional electricity used for lighting also introduces heat.  So then the heat loads also came down.  But then what about glare?  How do you control glare?  And again, a lot of research and experimentation led to this idea of introducing a light shelf  at a height of 1.3rd from the top of the glass, which bounces the light much deeper into the  space and ensures that the entire floor is lit.  But the light shelf also ensures that there is no glare, it shades the glass and ensures  that there is no glare coming into the eyes of people who are sitting right next to the  windows, right?  So the new building that inferses had no blinds and people could therefore look, even though  they had glass buildings earlier, they could not look outside and now in these buildings,  they had access to beautiful campus views all through the day.  Motors and in turn, pumps and fans consumed 60% of all the energy in the world, 60% and  so inferses took a target that how can we reduce that by a factor too?  Now if you see that in most of the plant rooms, there are lots of pipes all with 90 degree  bends, right?  What we are trying to do is we are pumping water, goes to 90 degree bend through friction,  loses some of the energy and then gets diverted, right?  So one of our brilliant engineers from Singapore, Mr. Lee Anglog, took inspiration from the  human heart, right?  He studied the human heart and found out that the human heart can pump 100,000 kilometers  through our body, through the blood vessels and consumes only 1.5 watt of energy per GPM,  whereas those chilla plants that we were designing are consuming 15 watts of energy per GPM.  As a result, he decided to eliminate 90 degree bends, if you want to achieve 90 degrees,  it was two 45 degree bends and what really resulted was more than a 2x reduction in this.  Imagine if this can, this idea can be taken by all industries across the world, what are  massive change we can drive?  The next level, the next target that we had given was reducing the HVAC energy by a factor  of 2, right?  Now why do we need air conditioning?  It's for comfort.  So we started researching what is comfort for somebody, right?  Because of metabolism, our body temperature, internal body temperature is at 37 and our  skin is at 34.  But what is your comfort level?  It's about 24, right?  In that range.  So if you want to be comfortable, you always have to give away heat.  Now when you explore, how does a human body really give up a heat?  You know physics has really taught us that heat is given up by either conduction, convection  or radiation.  And we know that the radiation is the fastest we have given you a heat, the sun's radiation  reaches you in 8 minutes and convection is the slowest, right?  In chemistry, school chemistry, we've learned that between solid, liquid and gas, the gas  molecules are far apart and is the least efficient in terms of heat transfer, right?  But what does air conditioning use?  Air conditioning uses air which is gas and uses convection.  So both according to physics and chemistry, in terms of heat transfer, air conditioning  is the least efficient, but is the most prevalent, right?  So it kind of baffled us.  And all of you have actually visited, you know, some of these places, you've gone to palaces,  you've gone to monuments, you've gone to caves and haven't you experienced that it's  really nice and cool, but there is no electricity there.  So there is no air conditioning.  So what is this mechanism, right?  And when you dive down deeper, you realize that these walls or these monuments or these  caves are much cooler than your body.  And the way your body is giving up a heat is by radiation to the surroundings and therefore  you feel nice and cool.  45% to 50% of how the human body gives up a heat is by radiation and we were not exploiting  that fact.  So what Infosys had decided to do was to work on how we can do this, right?  They put water pipes inside the slab during construction and started passing cool water.  What that did was exactly like a cave, the monument, it cooled down the slab, the concrete  and then people were able to radiate to the cooler slab and feel nice and comfortable.  Extensive studies at Infosys with the help of University of Berkeley revealed that this  cooling was far more comfortable.  There were no hot spots because, you know, engineering and air conditioning system requires  a lot of effort.  It's an art to ensure that there are no hot spots in the whole room.  Because I can radiate with my line of sight to any part in the room and feel nice and  cool.  And so this became the norm in the next 50 lakh square feet or 5 million square feet  of buildings were done with this new technology called reading cooling.  This is a big idea and has to be exploited if we really want because today in urban India  as people aspire to start using air conditioning in their homes, 50% of all electricity in  urban cities is going in air conditioning.  And so we have to innovate and we have to think differently on how we are going to cool  our future buildings, right?  And these are the kind of pipes that are put inside the slabs.  So Infosys achieved its goal of 2x and the reason for this is because now you are transporting  heat from your room to the exterior using water and water is 3400 times more efficient in  transporting heat than air.  And also you are using a much higher temperature waters to cool the slab as opposed to air  conditioning.  And so as a combination of these two, the energy reduction was more than 50%.  Now how do you prove that to the world and how does the world adopt this, right?  So what Infosys did in its first experimental building, they took a building in two halves,  the left half of the air conditioning and the right half was reading cool, right?  And the last seven years of data shows that the right half is more than 50% more efficient  and far more comfortable than the air conditioning side, right?  So in God we trust everybody else brings data, it was what Narayamurti kept telling all of  us and he wanted data to prove to the rest of the world that this is possible, right?  Now what we have is we have scientists from all of the world coming here to study and  experience this so that they can start implementing and recommending it in their buildings.  The next important thing is really to have control, okay?  Monitor and control is really, really important.  In this new IoT age, if you can monitor and manage all your assets really well, then you  can operate them at the most optimum level and that itself can lead to an additional 10  to 15% savings, maybe even more.  I have done audits of a lot of projects and I realize that you know just by operating  the system at its design levels, you can actually improve by a factor of 20, 25%.  And in terms of comfort, you know, the next big thing that is happening now is passing  on the controls in the hands of the users, right?  Today we put a sensor to tell us you know how cold it is or how warm it is and we put  a cut off saying that if it touches 24 degrees, you know, cut it off.  What if the sensor doesn't work, right?  The best sensor is our human skin, our human body.  We know whether if we feel hot, cold, less or more and so if we can actually on our  mobile phone can adjust it instead of using another sensor, we can really operate that  system at its very optimal level.  And I see this trend happening more and more where user control is going to take over from  sensors.  So how does all these learnings, right, help?  I mean, none of this can actually work and it cannot be, you know, it won't work unless  it is sustained by profits, right?  And so was this whole journey at Infosys profitable?  Well, what happened is that the lesser heat gain, right, for lesser heat gain they used  super insulated buildings, very high performing windows, all of that.  So that increased costs.  But what also happened is that they were able to reduce the cost of their equipments.  The mechanical equipments came down dramatically, which is the chillers, pumps, cooling towers,  A-choose, the size of all of those equipments came down dramatically.  The connected load, electrical load came down dramatically.  So the size of the DG sets, the transformers, the cables came down dramatically because these  two came down, the size of the utility building came down dramatically, right?  So all of this reduction in these costs, the MEP costs was far more than the cost they  invested in making the buildings more efficient.  So in the end, Infosys was able to save 5% in capital costs and 50% in operating costs.  So can we not take this learning from this one company over the last 10 years extremely  well documented and take these learnings to all over the world?  We tried that very hard.  We published all this information on the internet, but there are very few takers.  There are very, very few takers.  All the success stories of Infosys are having grown, their employees 10 by 120% at the same  time, the energy group only 13%.  They save $100 million in operating costs in 8 years, right?  None of this really made a big dent in developers in our country.  And so my one formula of really making change, driving change at scale is to incentivize  the developers dramatically.  If you give them a 25% additional profit, what will happen?  Overnight they'll do a PhD in green buildings, right?  And that will not just give them profits, but the tenants who are occupying these buildings  will pay 50% less in their electricity bills.  And electricity bills constitute about 25% of the rent, right?  Everybody around them will go because you will consume less resources.  So it's a benefit, it's a win-win-win situation for the developers, tenants, community and  the world in general.  And this I think is really important that we all collectively start demanding action  and driving change.  These are individual choices that can really drive change.  Thank you"
8,mp4,"So, some of you are probably wondering what's the Coca-Cola guy doing talking about sustainability. And all I can say is that I've learnt what to do and what not to do in my in my 30 year career in corporate and now that I've set up this business based out of the US, I guess I can talk to you as somebody who's been there, done that and can relate to some of these issues. So, I'm going to first start with a small comparison. Human beings, there are 7 billion of us, we collectively weigh 100 million tons biomass. We consume an average of 2 to 3 percent of our body weight in food every day. It's about a billion tons of food per year and what do we do? We pollute and we degrade the planet. And I hope most of you out here are aware of all the challenges. I'm not going to talk about that. I'm not here as an activist. But I do want to compare with ants. The total number of ants on this planet weigh exactly the same as human beings. They consume 20 percent to 30 percent of their body weight in food every day. That's 10 times as much food consumed as humans do. And like humans, they build ant hills or they build large constructions and unlike humans, ants enrich and enhance the environment. So, the question is how can we be more like ants? So, if there's only 3 things you take away from my session, the first is sustainability can drive growth and profitability for FMCG. I'm not here to tell you to spend your hard-earned money on, you know, kind of pie-in-the-sky ideas. The second is there are solutions available around the world. And the third is that all of you in this room collectively have to come together to make this happen in India because no single company here has the scale or the way with all to solve all the challenges that are facing the country, the sustainability challenges. So, first let me tell you what I believe sustainability is and isn't. And again, I'm telling this to you as a practitioner. I used to stand on stage with big NGOs and we've done some work in 1000 schools, we've done some work on water and that's all very good. But now in my new avatar I've realized that that's not sustainability. Sustainability is not about, you know, polluting the environment and then sending your employees to clean a beach. Sustainability is not about polluting the environment and then cutting a check to an NGO and saying, oh, we have done something good on sustainability. And at the same time sustainability is not a cost. It's not about lower profits and it's not about compliance. Sustainability is using fewer resources to deliver your desired consumer value by generating less waste across your entire value chain. If you do this right, you can actually make more money, deliver more consumer value and save the planet at the same time. And my goal over the next few minutes is to just share with you examples from a very small subset of solutions that we have collated at our business to give you a sense of what's possible. But before I go there, I just want to share with you something that maybe most of you are familiar with but I'll just recap. The old way of doing business was the linear economy. You extract non-renewable resources. We convert that into raw materials. We make it, we pack it, we sell it, consumers consume it and then they waste and the waste goes to landfill or the environment. That was the linear economy. But today we all talk about the circular economy and I presume most of you have heard of this which is recover, reuse, recycle, reprocess and push whatever you put out there back into your value chain and you reduce the waste and you reduce your resource intensity. That's a circular economy and if you can make it purely circular which no one can but people try, you can stop waste and stop resource extraction. But the future is what I'm calling the regenerative economy where you take waste as a raw material and your output regenerates the environment. And if you think that science fiction, I'll show you some examples of people doing that. Now I can talk about sustainability with regard to plastics, to water, to climate, to community and everything else but given the time and given the audience, I'm focusing only on sustainable packaging solutions and there's a whole lot more behind that. So I'm going to walk you through a ladder of solutions that you can implement as FMCG players. And the ladder starts with the most basic price of entry, recyclability of your packaging. Last week I was visiting Delhi so somebody invited me to Muradabad to see a recycling centre and great experience for me because I saw my previous company's products, lots of these bottles being recycled over there and I asked the recycler what are the challenges he faces and the first thing he told me is that there are still many companies whose products are designed in a way that is hard to recycle. And I'm not talking about just the multi-material stuff that we are all aware of but even something as simple as bottles, the labels if they made out of PVC, you can't recycle them. So what I urge all of you to do is in your companies go back, whenever you design a package, get your package designer, your material suppliers, everyone to also talk to the people who recycle it or who collect it or segregate it to make sure that you are designing for recyclability and you are designing for value in the package for all players in the chain at the end of life. But once you have made it recyclable, how much recycled content are you putting back into it? Today in Europe there are companies that are selling products in 100% recycled pet bottles. I know that that's not permitted in India, even though it's happening clandestinely but it's not permitted in India. It should be allowed in India and there should be a system, look at all the bottles of water we have on this table, right? Does anyone know what happens to that at the end of this? I mean the industry says it's 90% recycled, even if you believe that number, that 90% recycled is not really recycled back into bottles. It goes, half of it goes into the organized sector where it goes into polyester fibre which then gets converted into t-shirts, bags and other things, carpets and once used it gets discarded because it can't be recycled further. So true recyclability means it comes back in the same form that it went out, goes back into packaging. I'm very excited to hear about Unilever, I don't know if anyone is still here from Unilever or Hindsan Unilever. They have started a recycling program in India where you go from HDP, recycled HDP back into shampoo bottles and they've got a fully circular packaging system now in India and that's happening elsewhere in the world. So make your package recyclable and use recycled content in it. But if you think back to the past, those of you that are old enough to remember, we used to drink our soft drinks in glass bottles. By the way it's still available across the country but it's mostly in small towns or in small stores. When I was at Koch, nearly half our business used to come from returnable glass bottles and for those of you who think that this is not practical, it's not profitable. How many of you here have heard of Rajamundri? Great. So Rajamundri is a small town in the Godavi district and there are three districts out there that are managed by a Coca-Cola bottler who has the largest proportion of returnables in his business. Almost 70% of the paxi cells are returnable glass. He has the highest margins, the highest market share and the best return on investment amongst all our bottlers, amongst all Koch's bottlers. I'm not mine anymore. But returnable business if handled well can actually be a very profitable business. And I know it only applies to certain categories. But interestingly this other one that I'm showing you a loop, I don't know if you've heard of this. So loop is an initiative by TerraCycle of the US in partnership with Unilever, PNG and a number of other companies. They have launched a returnable system for personal products like shampoos, detergents, cosmetics and other things. So you consumers order the stuff, it comes to the home when they want to refill. The refills come and the old packages go back, a fully recyclable system. And this is actually gaining ground in other parts of the world. India is ripe for this because consumers in India are still used to reusing and recycling the packages. But there's also a solution where you can unpackage your product. Right? So most of you must have had Coca-Cola from McDonald's dispensing fountain. Dispensing is a good system. It's the most efficient way to deliver product. Today there's a company called Algrammo. Again, they've tied up with Unilever and Nestle out of Chile. I don't know how many of you have heard of Algrammo. So Algrammo is now coming out of Chile and going global. They sell dispensed products of every kind at a 30% discount to Walmart. 30% discount to Walmart, which is the cheapest or the lowest priced store in the world. I don't know if Chris is here, but I know Chris is supposed to be here later. But so Algrammo has come out with a system which they partner with the small Kiranha shops in Chile. They sell products directly from their three wheeler tempo and consumers can bring returnable containers and take exactly as much as they want. And they get a huge discount on that. They also have a returnable package. In Florida, there's a company that now sells products of Unilever Nestle, not Nestle, PNG, Unilever and other companies in dispensing mechanism like a fountain. So you can actually get, again, your personal products from a dispensing machine. Another trend that we are seeing, which you can look at, is concentrate. Basically, sell your product, don't sell water. When you package a product, sometimes you're sending as much as 78% water in it. When you sell it and concentrate from like Truman's, which is got acquired by or invested in by Hengkills, you save not only on packaging, you shave on shipping and your consumer gets a lower price. PNG in US went one step further. They've taken out the liquid completely. They have a range called EC 30. Again, anyone from PNG here? Yeah. So they have a range called EC 30 in the US, which is where they've developed a whole range of personal care products and shampoos and soaps and detergents with no water at all. So they don't need to package in plastic. They sell it in completely compostable packaging. So you can make a package recyclable. You can use recycled content. You can use reusable refillable packaging and you can dispense it. You can concentrate it. The one thing I want to highlight out here is biodegradability. I was in a flight, Sara airline's flight and they proudly served cutlery that said this is biodegradable. I was curious, so I looked at the cutlery and it's made from PLA bioplastics, polylactic acid. Well, PLA bioplastics are not really biodegradable except in industrial compostable facilities which require 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 80 degrees centigrade for three months. It won't biodegrade. So we have to be very careful when you talk about sustainability in packaging, especially not to get carried away by fads or what's called green wash where you make a claim that's technically correct, but in reality, doesn't really mean more sustainable. On the other hand, in India, we now have a range of tableware products that are fully compostable and are made from waste agriculture products. And that's the kind of stuff we should be looking at, but we have to be careful not to get, not to green wash or not to have stuff that can be claimed sustainable but doesn't really lead to sustainability. The next one, edible packaging, how many of you have had this? So there are two startups, one in UK, one in Indonesia, both of whom have discovered how to take seaweed and make a plastic polymer out of it, fully edible. In Indonesia, they're using it to wrap McDonald's burgers, they're using it to wrap the soaps and other things and in North Carolina and UK is using it to package beverages and also to package various other products. It's edible packaging and hopefully it's going to be coming to India soon. If you don't want to have any packaging footprint whatsoever, you can have what's called a disappearing package. How many of you here have ever used those pouches that go into a dishwasher and wonder where it goes, right? It's PVOH, it disappears. It basically dissolves in water, leaves no residue, nothing. So if you think about it, both edible packaging, for instance, you could have, I see all the good cup packets all over the country, right? Why couldn't the good cup packets or good cup be made or packed in an edible pouch which you can just pop in your mouth? Why can't we have shampoo sashes with a soluble package which when you use it in the bathroom, it just disappears in the water. It can be done. It's available. Again, not in India, but it's available. And finally, I told you about regenerative economy which is using waste to make a product and then the byproduct regenerates the environment. So there's a company in Singapore called R WDC Industries. They have, they make this bioplastic called PHA. They use waste cooking oil. There's another company that uses waste, sugar cane, bagasse. They use bacteria to create a bioplastic called PHA and then they make plastic sort of it. They've launched biodegradable straws. They're going to be launching cups and other things that are 100% biodegradable, compostable in the environment. If you discard them, they won't harm the environment. And at the same time, they use a waste product as a raw material. And they become food for bacteria and other creatures when they're discarded in the environment. Not that we're recommending you do that, but if it gets littered, it doesn't harm the environment. These are just an example of, we have over a thousand solutions on our website, but the exciting thing is that entrepreneurs, there's a ground swell of innovations happening around the world and entrepreneurs are coming up with innovations. That today, most of these, they may be at their infancy, but companies are finding smart ways to convert these technologies into, into solutions, which you can then actually make more money, offer lower cost to your consumer and minimize your impact on the environment. So what should the way forward for FNCD in India be? The first is, you have to collaborate. None of these technologies will be a reality in India if Deepak is expected to be the only one to buy one of them, because you don't have the scale. You need scale and to get scale, you need to have an industry standard. If the industry goes behind a specific polymer, or if the industry goes behind a specific package format, then suppliers will have the confidence to set up local manufacturing facilities in India, or local entrepreneurs will set up big facilities to grow their business. The other thing is collaboration across functions, across the value chain, across industry. And finally, I encourage the industry to also work with the government to support sensible policies with regard to packaging. Because if the industry doesn't take the lead and promote and support sensible policies with regard to packaging, the government, like I've seen in many other countries, will essentially pass knee-jerk regulations and bans. And we'll all be scrambling to find solutions that are not optimal. And examples of that sensible policies are what does, what are the standards for bioplastics, right? What are the standards for recyclable content in beverages? Why can't we allow recyclable PET in bottles? All those things are policies that encourage a circular economy and make sure that you don't end up with a lot of litter on the ground. So, in closing, all I'm going to say is you've got to act now because the planet can't wait, and your consumers won't wait. Because the next generation of consumers, you all know this. Greta Thienberg over here. Well, Greta's started a movement that now has a hundred million followers around the world, and they're all your consumers. And just as she's watching every government and berating them in the UN, your consumers are watching you. They're watching us. And they are going to hold us accountable for taking the lead on sustainability. So with that, I'll close my session.     "
9,mp4,"Okay, good morning everyone. I hope you can hear me well and welcome to our webinar dedicated to  shelf management, data-driven shelf management should be more specific. And first of all,  I would like to thank you for participating in case you have any questions during the course of  the webinar. Do not hesitate to ask in the chat. And first of all, I'd like to introduce ourselves.  So my name is Andre Voghe. I'm the Data Sentics. Data Sentics is a machine learning company that  serves many clients also from the retail and e-commerce industry. And my personal experience  is from the FM CG sector and retail sector, as well as data analytics. I've been in consulting  and I've been working with companies in retail for about 80 years in the delivered numerous  projects in the area. And I'm very happy that here with us is Mr. Tibor Molnare from Nestles,  Slovakia. So please, Tibor, if you could introduce yourself.  So, hi everyone. Tibor Molnare, I'm Field Sales Manager in Nestle. My experience, I'm 20 years  with Nestle, last 10 years. I'm at the position of Field Sales Manager and I'm responsible for  the Field Salesforce in Slovakia. And the categories are confectionery,  deviated food and coffee and beverages. Thank you. And so we can get started. So first of all,  I would like to share the content of the webinar. So we've done successfully the first part introducing  ourselves and then we will follow with a little survey to get you know better. And then we'll go  to the definition of self-management, what it is, why it is important, why we should pay attention  to it. And what are the main challenges that the business is facing every day? Then we will move  on to the question how to ensure the on-shelf availability, the everlasting question of retail  and our approach that we believe when you answer three main questions that we think are important  as for on-shelf availability, you'll be able to, let's say, provide your customers better and make  sure that the goods are there. And in the last part, we will dedicate part of this webinar to our  cooperation with Nestle, the case study we have prepared for you. And in the last part,  we will try to answer the questions that we will be collecting in the chat sector during the whole  webinar. So do not hesitate to ask any time. All right. So if I may ask my colleague,  Konsa, who is here in the background organizing the whole thing to start the survey,  or I think I can. Okay, good. I hope you can see the survey now. And I would like to ask you to  answer your background while you are here, what it is important to you so that we know, so that we  know what is, let's say, important to you what we should focus on.  Okay, I can see what we have collected about 70% of answers. So we can move on. Oh, there is  some more answers coming. All right. Okay, so we can see that we have a nice, let's say, combination  of all the parts of the industry. We have some FMCCG producers. We have people from business  consulting, and I'd like to maybe ask the other who they are or what their main area of focus is,  that'd be really nice if you stuff so that we know what to speak about. All right, so  let's get back to the presentation.  Okay, great. So, shelf management, what it is, why is it important? So I found some nice definition  of shelf management, so I just copied it. And it says that shelf management includes the product  placement, the merchandising on retail shelves, as well as keeping products fully stocked and  effectively organized. And I think the last part of the sentence is the most important one.  And I think that shelf management is composed of four, let's say, parts or components, and  that define the shelf management. One of them is space. Space is the definition and the limitation  of shelf management. At the same time, it's about operating with the space, reducing out of stocks,  challenging the shrinkage and waste management. It's about space elasticity management and logistics,  obviously, because the space also is limited and logistics. Then it's positioning. Positioning  is about the goods being positioned well on the shelves, rotated, facing the customer. It's about  heat mapping of the stores. It's about eye tracking of the customers, knowing where they go, where they  go, where they don't go, what's appealing to them, and so on. It's about store planning and  customer routing within the store, making sure that he sees the products that we want him or her to see.  Then, obviously, it's about portfolio, about the goods and the products you would like to  distribute, the depth of distribution, choosing the right assortment. Over time, then, obviously,  the product lifecycle management comes in question, knowing when to launch the product, when to launch  a new design of the product, and is also about the demand prediction, stored clustering, and knowing  which stores perform well with which products. In order to be able to do all of this, we need data.  So, it's also about measurement and analytics of all the about mentioned, knowing how we perform in  which store which product is available at what time and so on. Then, some performance dashboards  and analytics that are built upon this information. Obviously, it all sounds very well right now,  but there are many challenges that you all know from your day to day business.  So, let's go to this. Here, I'd like to start with some extreme examples of challenges. Obviously,  this is not what the everyday store looks like. These are some extremes I'd like to pinpoint.  So, bad on-shelf availability. It's the number one problem in question,  and obviously, this is an extreme example where no goods are available, and this is very difficult  to challenge because obviously, there was a mistake in the logistics. For your information,  these shelves come from the Netherlands right after the first wave of the COVID virus, and people were  just raiding the stores and buying everything that was available there. Then, you have some  pricing challenges where sometimes the price is not correct or the discount is not presented well.  And on these pictures, you can see examples from Walmart, which is infamous with their  pricing mistakes. We can say that because most of the people in this webinar are from Europe, I think,  or some North Africa or Middle East. So, there I have never experienced such extreme examples of  pricing mistakes, but they can happen. And we know from our experience that sometimes the price  that can be incorrect even in our areas. So, this is something that we should focus on because,  obviously, the producers are paying large amounts of money for having their products discounted,  displayed properly and priced well, and if this doesn't happen, then everybody's losing money.  And the last part is shelf share. This is a picture from Germany, and obviously, it's not  that somebody displayed it like this. It's an attack of a person who tried to destroy the alcohol  in this particular example, but shelf share is something that you have agreed upon with  the retailer. It's about you having some definite percentage of the shelf compared to your competition  compared to the whole portfolio compared to your flavors of products. And especially in the traditional  trade, it's sometimes difficult to get these and to make sure that the situation is like  it is agreed on and like it is presented in your contract. So, it's very important for all the  producers to have their shares as they prefer and as they wish. As I mentioned, these examples are  not something you would see every day in the stores. And for this reason, I'd like to go maybe back  to the reality and to show you something that can happen that it's also possible to challenge  and change. So here, we can see some real shelves. These are Nest products in Slovakia.  And you can see that some of the products are missing. Some of the products are in the back  and they are not facing the customer. Some of the products are completely missing. They are out of  stock or shelf. We cannot say just from these pictures, but it's obviously problematic because  if we can see it on the pictures, then neither can the customer. And even the coffee in the middle,  it's very, very much in the background. And even the customer cannot sometimes see it and  approach it. I mean, there is another product right next to it. But the point is, if it's not  right there and if it's not properly displayed, then it can affect the sales.  So how can we change this or how can we deal with this?  So obviously, the first answer that comes to your mind is to do some store checks to  send the people to inspect the stores, to see if the goods are displayed properly, if the  merchandising compliance is okay, if the products on the secondary placements are where they are,  and so on. But this is costly and this is very hard to scale, especially if you have  thousands of stores that you are serving, just like Nestle does in all the countries, including  Slovakia, where Mr. Monares is the head of the whole operations. And these are the, let's say,  three main questions you are looking to answer for. And this is, if the retail partners display  your products the way they should, if the price is correct, as I showed on the pictures before,  and if the shelf shares are correct. And I read a lot of studies on this done on  different merchandisers in sales reps doing store checks and data collection, and then double  checks of these data. And depending on the methodics that you use, the display inspection can be  from 15 to 40 percent invalid or incorrect. There can be made up data, there can be mistakes,  because they are collected with hands. And it's very inefficient in a way that you have to send  the same amount of people to all the stores in order to get the data. So this can be difficult.  And why is it important that something I would like to recap, because we have,  I've described it earlier, but there are some newcomers I can see. And I've been discussing  this with Mr. Monares, and he told me that there is just one main reason why everybody does that,  and that's selling and achieving sales, because the on shelf availability makes money. It makes  you money. If you're the producer, it makes you money if you're the retailer, because if the  two goods are not there, you just simply cannot buy them. And this is the main idea behind all of  this. And no matter how deep you go into discussions, this is what it always comes down to. Obviously,  there are some other, let's say, secondary reasons why you should make sure that your goods are  displayed in the right amount and in the right fashion. That means they are neatly presented.  They are facing the customer the right way. One reason is brand image and awareness,  because as a producer, it's very difficult for you to communicate with your customers directly.  You can manage some social media channels. You can communicate with different blog posts. You can  engage in discussions and reviews. But it's an indirect way of communication, while when your  goods are displayed well and properly and in the right and neat amount, it communicates with the  customer. And the customer says, OK, this brand is presented well. It's a reliable product. It looks  nice on the shelf. I would like to buy that. Another study I read, discuss it on,  discussed on whether, what is the longer impact of sales compared on sales compared between the  discounts and the merchandising? They were comparing the amount of money invested in  into these two categories. And the outcome of the study says that the impact of right on shelf  availability is longer and more lasting than simply discounts. Because if it comes to discounts,  people just buy it because of the price. But if the goods are displayed well, then  it's something they will buy repeatedly because they can rely on that. And it's very important,  especially in low-walled categories. Those are categories where people usually don't go or they  don't go there every time they visit the supermarket. And in these, like, if you only get a couple of  chances, and if your shelf is messy, then it's very hard to re-engage the customer and  reconvene him or her to buy your products. And this also accounts for spontaneous purchases,  which is somewhat similar to low-wall categories. But let's say this is in categories that are  high-walk, but people do not always buy in these categories. And a lot of, or some of the products  that Mr. Moana is responsible for fall into this category, become a mistake, especially  the chocolate and candies and stuff like that, right? So these are always, and that's why we are  challenging this as well together to make sure that the goods are available on shelf in this way.  Because the spontaneous purchase only can happen if the goods are there.  All right. Let's move on. Let me just go very fast in the comment section. If there are some  interesting questions that have a reason. Oh, yeah. So there is some discussion. But no direct  questions, if I'm not mistaken. Oh, yeah. There is some discussion about how this affects the  e-commerce. Let me just really very fast. Oh, yeah. If how this relates to e-commerce, if the shelf  management is a applicable topic in the e-commerce, maybe I can go because I'm looking at the time,  we are a little ahead of the schedule. So I can make a little break and just discuss on this if  you don't mind. I think that as I was saying, it's a way how the e-commerce business can learn  from the old fashion, let's say, but still very relevant brick and mortar. Because brick and mortar  has been doing it for ages and they know how to communicate with the customer and even commerce,  it's all easier to accomplish because you have data on everything you have data on your customer,  what he or she is looking at while in the brick and mortar, you have to experiment with those like  the goggles that monitor the eyeballs movement and stuff like that. And it's very pricey and it's very  difficult to scale. Anycomers, you have all the data at your finger point and you can just analyze  them. So obviously you can adjust the way that your display or products to each customer separately  based on his history and his login. And this is something that we also are doing in data  semantics. And there are other people who are more proficient in this area than I am. And let's say,  for instance, Peter Guarra, what I was discussing this topic in the comments. So definitely,  if this is of interest to you, you can connect with him or me on LinkedIn. We can get into this  discussion. But I think e-commerce is just the best soil to experiment with all these things.  And maybe in the future, we will then learn something from the e-commerce and apply it in the brick  and mortar again. So make the full circle. Okay, let's go back into our discussion. And this is  something, yes, how do I ensure the on shelf availability? So now we know that it's important.  We know that you should focus on that because unless it's there, you cannot sell. And obviously,  you are serving many stores. You are serving many retailers. You have multiple categories  and sometimes even more displays in one store. You have the primary shelves. You have the secondary  placements. And then there is time, a very, very important factor because not all products are sold  in the same way throughout the whole week. Some products are heavily sold before weekends or on  the weekend. Some products are sold before and after working hours and so on. And to combine all  these factors and come to a conclusion, it can be difficult. So you need to go step by step and  make sure that you have answers to all of these bullet points to know where to start your focus  because everybody has a limited resource. And everybody has a limited capacity of who they can  send to the stores to collect the data and then obviously analyze the data. And how is it done?  That's probably something that I would like to ask you if you don't mind sharing with us in the  comments. If you have any best practices about how often or how do you choose these answers  to these questions? Because I will be focusing on that later in the presentation. But now I'd like  to maybe get some inspiration or answers from you or more if you could maybe add something to this.  So basically from my point of view, we have to add the first star and to the basics. And the  basics are the home shelf. So that's the first point. What I'm looking in the store, and I'm  checking the exposure of our products. So basically home shelf is the first point and then this place  and secondary placement in the stores. So this is very often increasing our visibility in the stores  in the first round and the second round. This is like, let's say during the promotion,  like our secure stock to not to go to out of stock with the products. So that's our approach.  And on top of this, then the cash design zones, where we have an impulse product. These are the  places in the store, which are the third main focus area for our service.  Yeah, thank you. Oh, sorry, I maybe switched to the back to the presentation. My apologies.  Yes, and this is somewhat, I mean, in any case of Nestle, you have some sort of order in this  and logic, obviously Nestle is the biggest food producer in the world. They have some best practices.  But not all companies are at the same level of maturity and they have different logics in  approaches to this. This is something I have learned over my career and communicating with  many companies that sometimes it's, let's say, surprising to see that some companies have an  approach that you would not expect them to have and vice versa. I mean, it works in both extremes.  Sometimes it's the historical reasons. Like we have been doing this like this for ages, we have  this merchandise, a gauge you see that have been with us for 15 years and we just go once a week  because that's what we do. Sometimes it's corporate strategy. Sometimes there's a  headquarters somewhere and they just tell all the local branches that the check has to be done  in this in that fashion because there is some strategical reasoning behind that because  you have maybe some tool, IT tool or some process in place that is aligned with this  frequency of data collection. But I believe, and I've been sharing this species of information  also on my LinkedIn profile and some blog posts that in order to answer or how to, in order to  be able to decide when and where to check and how you need to answer these three questions.  So I'd like to go into them and maybe speak a little about these questions and some sub-questions  of these questions so that everybody can, let's say, think it over and answer them for any more  herself. So this is my product portfolio and this is how I think I should check on my product.  So the first question is when? It means how often should you check on your products? Should it be  once a day? Should it be once a week, once a month? What determines this frequency?  And we have discussed about why, there is some sub-questions. We have discussed why should you  check on your product and all these sub-questions, they follow the logic of the blog posts. So we have  said that without any information from the market, you do not know about your planogram compliance,  merchandising compliance. You are investing money into something that you don't know if you're  getting it. So obviously you need to justify your investment. Then the second sub-question,  the most important one I think is what determines the optimum frequency.  And as I said, it differs dramatically from one company to one another. And as I was very  surprised to learn, there is no direct connection between the size of the portfolio and the frequency  of the checking. Some companies have hundreds of SKUs and they evaluate them once a month.  The other companies will discuss with us that they would like to have nearly real-time data  collection in order to tell if they are getting the value, if the placements make any sense and so on.  Even though their product portfolio only consisted about two dozens of SKUs. So these are some  learnings and some justifications that you have to make for yourself. And the minimal frequency  usually copies the merchandising activities. So if you change your secondary displays and temporary  placements, let's say once in two weeks, you want to make sure that you have the product displayed  properly and you are getting the compliance. If it's business as usual sometimes, even biweekly  or monthly checks come into place, if you have the sales representative or merchandising  team, large enough you can cover all the stores in a month, then you can perhaps live with this.  But another thing that is very important here is the category or the product that you are selling.  Because if you are selling something that is rarely distorted by the seasonality, then it doesn't  really matter if it's Tuesday morning or Sunday night. You are probably getting the same amount of  attention and your product will sell similarly. While if you have a portfolio that is  very distorted by the time of the day or by the seasonality, like I don't know,  side their beers or something that is affected by weather. I mean alcohol in general is a good  example. I wanted to avoid this but it's the first one that came into my mind. So that's something  that's very very seasonal and also it changes over time. Like fresh food or the package fresh  like sandwiches are usually sold in the mornings and then it goes down during the day and so on.  So these are hard to predict just from monthly KODATA collection and for this you need a higher  frequency. While if you have products like olive oil, mineral water, these kind of products they  sell well pretty much all the time because people just buy during their regular purchase and  and for this you do not need that much frequent data collection.  And the last part and then I will pass the word back to Mr. Molnak to maybe share a little  insight from Nestle. Who should consider real time checking? By real time checking, I mean  getting data on hourly basis, knowing the data immediately from the point of the data collection.  This is usually good for companies that have a lot of secondary placements and they have,  as I said, the very seasonal goods are goods that sell well in particular parts of the day  and are usually displayed in like fridges and so on where they need to know if they're getting  the value from the from these placements. And for this reason we have already done projects with  IOTs where you collect data from weight mats that measure the weight of the goods and tell you if  people are collecting the cans, in this case it was beer but it also were very well for energy  drinks we were experimenting with and you can say if you're getting the value you are expecting  from this. So for this we can set up some infrastructure and install these devices and this is what we  have been doing but I don't want to jump into some sales activities so I'll just ask my word  to Mr. Molnak to share some real info from Nestle. Well if I should answer the headline question  my answer would be as often as possible so that would be like easy. On the other hand  we have to find some balance between cost and efficiency so means I cannot send in every store  in the country every day sales report mentioned either because I don't have stuff for this  and resources so we have to find balance between the resources what we have and find a way where  to send our people to have the higher outcome from every single visit. So this is the key question  what we have how to ensure that we will send the people to the stores where the edit value of their  job is at the highest level so and that's the moment what we're trying to answer with this system so  because there are some retailers and this is independently from how good their internal systems are  that some of the stores from the retailers are manageable and some not so well so and the  edit value of the people when they are coming in the stores I don't need to send the people  into the stores where everything is going well and the shelves are fully stocked and everything  is going like really good and now I'm speaking about the modern trades means the international  players that in this type of stores their edit value is near to zero and I have to see the  problems or the stores where we have out of stocks and try to solve these problems so if  I would ask for all these questions I have to have data where to send my people to have  the highest edit value from their visits. Yeah that's somewhat let's say some part of the next  question we're answering is really good. I can see that there was a comment from Mike Price that  in India a Unilever used to measure every day in large format grocery stores, general,  banner, category dynamics and store specific attributes can all influence frequency of  measurement and it's very important to pinpoint that sometimes a lot of factors come into play  and it's hard to pinpoint the very one that determines it and it surprised me that I mean  India I don't know how many stores they were serving but it must have been a very large  operation to measure everyday presence in all of India so that's a nice way to learn something  I couldn't even imagine such a large scope. So let's go into the next question and that's  the question of where because as Mr. Molinar was saying you would like to check as frequent as  possible and as many sources as possible but obviously it's hard to choose which ones and  should you focus on traditional or modern trade maybe I can go into the definition I don't know  if it's the same all over the world but in our area we understand the traditional trade as some  local let's say retail chains where modern trains are usually large retail international  chains that have some standardized format and presence and so on so this is how we distinguish  them like a Tesco would be an example of a modern trade in our whereabouts and this is a question  that it can only be the answer with data as Mr. Molinar was saying because you can think that  that you should focus on the stores where you have the largest sales but it doesn't necessarily  need to be the case because sometimes you have the best sales in a store that's located in some  recently opened as supermarket or some shopping mall and it's well managed because it's a new  one and even though you make great sales they are the on shelf availability is always perfect because  it's also of their interest to present the goods and sell the goods and they just know why they're  there their rent is very high and they're just doing their best and you don't really need to pay  attention to this store while there can be a store a little one in some in some small town  where your sales are maybe 10% of what you're making in the main city but they are not paying  enough attention to your category or to your goods and they need some help and they need some more  time that you need to dedicate to them and make sure that your goods are sold well because if  if you make this effort then you are perhaps one of the very few in that store or in that town  that has this kind of perfect on shelf availability and and it pays well and you can even multiply  your sales in that store so all this is is very difficult without the data if i may add a small  store if you have in the countryside can be that the the sales is just a helpful for this in my  my story in the shopping mall but the potential is still there but it's not well managed and  i have to know it and without this information i'm blind and you know i'm sending the people  merchandising and sales reps to the stores where the edit value is zero and i'm missing this small  store in in the countryside so that's that's that's the point that i have to have like all the  information from the field to properly let's say send the people or to dedicate the sources on  in the in the stores so very much made it yeah yeah thank you for saying this it kind of confirms  that what i've been trying to say and it's very hard to say without data and there's something that  we we somehow do together because often and there's something i had to learn the hard way that the  planograms are not always available and you're obviously the easiest data collection will be  having the planogram in your left hand and and a pencil in your right hand and just marking the  products this is there and this isn't but it's not necessarily always the case so checking the  categories with the the planagram is not available in some stores can be harsh and for this we we  created a tool in that asentics where you can just take a picture of the shelf and digitalize the  information on the picture and let's say create a planogram from the picture and then this planogram  can be checked regularly and this is something we will describe more in detail in the case study  that will come right after the the third question that is how and and by how i only mean i do not  only mean who should be collecting the data but by how it can it can also mean by some let's say  tools ai driven tools iot tools and so on so it doesn't doesn't always have to be a person  sometimes it can be a machine let's say as in a simple in simple manner so obviously sometimes  you can you have to choose merchandiseers sometimes you have to choose your sales representatives  and sometimes you can go after all of these let's say iot tools like i mentioned earlier the  weight mats and and so on and in order to just determine whether you should go with the merchandisers  or if you if you are fine with the sales representatives i have learned that also it it differs from  company to company and there is no like direct answer to this but the sales represent the  the merchandisers is if you if you want to check a lot of a lot of chains and stores if you if you  think or you have a suspicion or hypothesis that your product display or on shelf availability  can be very different from from one one let's say shop of the same retailer in one city and another  while if you feel like the whole chain operates well then you you probably do not need to disperse  your work for so much all across the country so you should choose a merchandiser if you  just need to send them everywhere your where your office aren't where your sales representatives  can't reach and if you just want to operate in a whole area big area but there is always a  downside to these merchandisers are not your people they often serve different brands and  even sometimes on the same visit and they are not connected with your brand so their interest of  of accurate data collection is sometimes lower obviously they can be remunerated they can be  motivated with money and so on on the quality but it doesn't always work as well as you would like  while the sales representatives are your people they can be directly motivated by you to collect  the data and they have some sort of sense of how the products should display they know the products  they they want the products to be displayed well so this is the main important part if you if you  just feel that this this presence is is very important to you and you can you can just focus on some  some sub sub areas or sub-sets of the whole area you're serving then the sales reps are  all the are the right people and obviously the combination of this can happen as it happens  a lot so I would like to ask mr. Molner if you can add something to this and to your  wallet you mentioned almost everything but I would say the the view of on the nestler or to  company because if I would collect all the data by my sales reps it would be the most expensive way  obviously this is not the way so that but that was the reason why I chose to collect this data  through through merchandising merchandising agency and sure there will be some elimination  for them for the future and we will see how it goes in the future but the plan is that  to collect the data not from our sales reps because as I mentioned this is the most expensive way  so to find different ways currently the only one source what we have is some merchandising  for the future we will see my boss for example is a fan of crowd sourcing so we will see probably  this is one of the options for the future but nowadays and especially how we see that how the  model is working we have to have somehow trained stuff for the data collecting so it is not so easy  to collect all the dat"
10,mp4,"Hello everyone, good evening.  Okay, so let's start our webinar.  Hello everyone, welcome to our new chapter of College Junior Connect.  My name is Pooja Bhagwaya and I am the Program Manager of the Advanced Certification and Data Science Engineering Program  in association with E and ICT Academy and I differ in Power by College Tumia.  Today's webinar topic is How is Data Analytics Transforming the Apple City Industries?  Where we are going to talk about the FMC industry and our main focus area is the E and the most advanced common analytics projects and some data science algorithms  and some people later on discuss some case studies.  And you know, as data analytics have the FMC industry to reduce the cost, the invent production and the supply chain to take the products to the right target market at the right time.  And it also provides the companies with the necessity insights to adopt the data driven model for the decision making.  So to enlighten more on this part, I would like to introduce Mr. Ayush Chann. Hello Ayush.  Hello, Ayush, hello everyone, good evening.  So let me give us more intro about Ayush.  So Ayush shares 12 years of versatile experience in data science and machine learning algorithms.  And at present he is heading to data engineering and data science protocols at Hindustan Coca-Cola beverages and previously worked with many reputable platforms like Enforces, Testco, etc.  And he has completed his postgraduate diploma in data science from  pre-ed to pre-ed to pre-ed.  So let me share the attack directly.  Yeah, you can share the presentation.  Okay.  So please let me know whenever you can see the screen.  Yeah.  Is it different?  Yeah, it's visible.  And in the full mode, right? Not the small mode.  Yeah, it's a full mode.  Yeah, it's a full mode.  Great.  So good evening everyone.  Please stop me or raise your hand or speak with us.  I'm not audible or visible at any point of time.  I'll try to go a little slower than usual.  Viewers can write their potions if they are facing you and it out and something you can share your thoughts in this given a box.  Great, great, great.  So welcome everyone. What we are going to discuss here is, you know, you might already have heard multiple times that data science is important, data analytics is important.  This is important, that is important.  But why it is actually important?  What at least doing with the industry?  How it is helping? How it is transforming?  That is why it is important or that is why it is in highly demanding.  So this is what we are going to discuss. We of course, it's a wide wide topic and we cannot cover, you know, we can sit like for hours and days, but we still not able to finish our conversation.  So what we'll do is we'll discuss on one or two use cases and that particular, you know, give you a little bit glimpse about how it is being used and how it is having.  Before starting, of course, my intro has already been done by Pooja. So I can give a little bit about myself also that I've been working with CoBola for the past three and a half years now.  And I work mainly on projects like we customer segmentation or business transformation.  But the main goal is right now I have to bring or I have to bring value or quantify the value of data science or what about business, what we are doing.  And if I cannot do that, of course, we do have a job. It's not an IT. It's not business. It's somewhere we reside in the middle of it so that we connect business and bring out value out of it while using infrastructure from IT.  So those who all are, you know, who thought that or who think that data analytics or data science is IT, please don't. It's not.  I never, first time I worked in IT which was in P, but since then I've not worked with it. And I never associated with IT, but I'm still working on the data science or data related P since then.  So you can, if you're not from IT, you can definitely work in data science. That is usually one of the paradigms for people here.  Coming or moving forward, the agenda towards us, which I mentioned that we'll be looking towards what FMCG is and what actually what do we do with the FMCG in terms of analytics.  What other focus areas of course and then how data science is impacting and then as I said two case studies which can give you a bit of idea not not even idea but a bit of theoretical knowledge that how how you can or how you can.  Or how you can or how someone else can help industry and not only FMC industry, it relies on it cascades to other industries as well.  So it's because in past two, three years we have been looking forward, you know, looking towards ups and downs in every market.  And then we have FMCG, VIT, FAMA, VIT, any industry pick because of certain operations, what you're seeing, VIT, your current war going on, regulations here and there.  So these these operations have, you know, changed our ways of looking at things.  And forecasting mechanism, the trends, all these things have gone completely out of the box or out of the top right output now and no one is able to give the correct predictions.  So what FMCG was supposed to be earlier, we are not looking towards that but whatever the current situation is we can see.  But I believe is FMCG is one of the important pillars of at least Indian economy because we all love to, you know, things, to things very quickly and we are a little bit stereotypes.  For example, I'll give you an example that whenever we used to go to at least whenever I used to go out to the market and someone wants to buy a detergent.  So no one says that I want detergent, so they want to say I want serve or let's say if you're going out to buy a water purifier, no one says it's the water purifier, usually they say aqua guard.  So these teetrodiving, right, so that has come into us, you know, that has been embedded into us for so much time that we hardly think about other products.  So that is the major reason that many companies in FMCG or other areas, they have been with us from a very long time and companies like Maruti, companies like Of course you're at both the art companies like Xerox.  So these companies are with us from so long time that we do not know that there's anything exist out of that box or not.  And that is something which we personally see as an opportunity. So, faculty being fourth largest sector, it has a great growth despite the inflation of 10.9% which was around 16% last last year, which we were expecting to go.  And of course, any overall 2022 was towards digits throughout.  Then comes of uncharted territories, which I as I said, stereotyping the products, transportation, you would have read a lot of news that how vaccines were transported, people have to walk so much, they have to cross the river, they have to cross them out and all these things.  So because India is a diverse area in terms of geography, we do not know how to create a seamless transportation. Of course, Amazon, Flipkart, they have given us a lot of ways to do that.  They are able to send everything from one place to another, but we still face a lot of confidence. Apart from these few top five companies, no other companies can take it to this level.  And of course, that is the reason the cost in the knowledge is called all these things. It's been a biggest giant right now.  Third point, as I mentioned, inflation, mitigation. I do not know that if what the inflation percentage may be may happen next year because of what so called reasons.  And what should I do to mitigate that so that I can force, I can, you know, commit the inflation and my profit in the middle so that I do not lose money out of it.  So this is something which all of us are facing together.  Multiple initiatives, of course, digitization is one of the initiatives. You all are, you know, you all are participants in that since past three years.  Maybe it's a revolution or it's a requirement, whatever you call it. But are you PI only pay T and you name it.  This payment terms, digitization of payments as, you know, it was an explosion, you know, that everyone got into that.  So this is digitization and your buying selling, transferring things, reselling all these things have digitized so much that many of our lives have become easier.  But how to go forward from there? That is one of the things that we are looking at.  And of course, our B2C, which is like business to consumer, I actually are D2C what we call it, I had to consumer.  That has also increased a lot. So why that happened because companies got to know that I do not need to go via channel.  Like, Kia Kao just give you that or the other matter. I can directly sell to my consumers.  And you would see that a lot of startups or any startup which is being rising in past decade or past five years, I would say, they are focusing on direct to consumer.  And all of you were like fan of short banks. You would have seen that how D2C has been changing lives.  And of course, our government is also helping FMCG by putting FDI or, you know, reducing more data, reducing the claw on these businesses, little losing area so that we can have more FDI, we can have more in flow of the money from outside.  That is the overall overview of FMCG. But why do we are here? Because in my past career that I have seen that any problem or most of the problems of FMCG realize or come down to these projects or these topics actually.  So, is it consumer behavior and non-reduction? Is it plastic free packaging or something which is going to be a big, big thing? And what we call it, KSR if you guys are aware of the term getting environment, social responsibility, environment, social regulations.  So, that is, you know, that is going to be a big thing in future because government wants us to be plastic free as soon as possible. And we do not see, you know, as easy.  And I, for the one, you know, is one of the, we are the culprits actually, not the victims actually because no one has found a solution to go away from plastic.  Then of course, AR of customer experience, or reality, you would have heard about multiple initiatives or multiple projects like you do not need to go to any particular area. You can just sit at home and look at the, I think metaverse is one of the biggest examples you must have been hearing about that.  I am not sure whether this will fly across, but this is something which will come back and you take examples of that. How do you try your clothes or shoes while staying at home? So, that is something, one of the, you know, any research areas which is fine.  Then of course, operations, which we spoke about, but its operations, not the actual business. So, operation is something that right from buying material to produce something and on the way to sell it, to send it to the customer. Do I have whole process digitized or not?  If it is yes, then people like me will be out of the job that we are driving those strategies, but this is something which every company talks about or works on. Social media based marketing, so in this we need influencing marketing or be it any other ways of marketing that has been going around from past  decade, I would say. And what more they can do, how they can project their image in a better manner, that is something. Then of course chatbots, diet distribution, IOTs, all these things are very, very highly demand in my container.  One thing, what you will find out of this, all topics, these somewhere or something, they are, you know, would require data science analytics or rendering around it and without that it won't be possible.  So, you pick up any person from any area out of it and they will say that we need people. So that is that, that is proof that we will be needing more data science or data science related roles or people in the future. And because this is something which everyone will be working upon.  If I have to club them or submit them to four major ideas, I would say if I am in industry, I will focus on only customer product, distribution and market. How customer like am I targeting the right customer? Am I giving them right support and right requirements?  If it is a product, it's my costing or my profit amount or my revenue around the product is right or not. What if I am selling product for a hundred rupees per time? It is costing $150. So I will be keep losing it, but I cannot pull it out from the market or I cannot introduce any product because I will change increase the price, that will give me a loss.  So we will discuss that in one of the case studies and the right design of the product is one of the major things you would have heard about product designing.  Even you are designing some of the major areas where people are speaking about or working out.  Market is one thing is completely different from the customer because market is something which companies focus initially that for example, many companies did not exist even in India because they did not see it as a right market.  It's not our customer, they may have a customer say but as a market it was not exhibiting the right properties. So how do you activate your product? How do you place your product in that particular market?  That place is very vital. Biggest example you want to hear about, read about Bingo, read about how did they came into this, read about Kia, read about MG, how they are coming into different markets.  They will give you a lot of things and of course, cool hours you would have heard about that.  So distribution is something how do you provide your product from your warehouse, your factory to customers hands.  So all that how much it costs so it should not take enough money so that it will cost me more than the product.  So of course that's why you would obviously see the shipping fee or delivery fee, all these things play a many vital role because that's in its amount of distribution and it's an overhead because you cannot exist with the product if you cannot send it to the customers.  And we all are in the era where we need everything right at our food. Then of course risks and fraud is something you would have heard whenever the Realizations or any business involved, it always it is always vulnerable to risk and frauds which how they are going to be distribution.  For example, you might have heard that someone ordered a Mac or someone ordered something very expensive, they found a break, they found a store or something, all these things and it all went around although that someone ordered a laptop.  They said I do not want it to return it back and it was something else altogether.  So you cannot prove it and who did it, did the delivery company or is it a own company or is it a customer.  It's a long, long, long process.  So these are the focus areas of M&C G, at least my my my preview and what are the common algorithms data.  You would be hearing this from non words when you step into data science journey.  So when it comes to customer, FADL is this on which I've been working very, very, very recently.  A.I.B.S. chatbot that I do not want to waste my resources on what we like lesser transaction analysis or maybe simple selling your balance.  So it can be done through chatbots, let it be.  Then of course product we price lastly something we will be discussing in one of our case studies and conjure analysis and how do I, you know, do analyze ways of my spend in the different areas.  Then market, how market is modeling, customer segmentation, when it comes to distribution of course, RGM and all the way to detection.  All these things actually are, you know, very common algorithms which you will find and even if you pick like one or two, they really matter to multiple companies because these are common, irrespective of some time the industry also.  So these algorithms can be used not only as M&C but other industries also regardless of their searching nature.  So number one case study, what you have time I'll jump to that.  Number one case study what we will be discussing about affiliate analysis or market past analysis or usually we call it the API or their multiple names to that.  It's a simple thing that if I have to buy, if I have to suggest or recommend a particular product to a customer, how do I do that?  So you may be looking at YouTube or you go to Amazon.  So whenever you buy any product on Amazon, let's say you buy a food and as soon as you add it to your cart, image it, message would come to you know, people who bought this also bought this, people who bought this.  Also, other people are also looking at these products.  So how do they get to know that or how do they know what to suggest?  So that is what the affiliate analysis is.  So what they do is they usually take the, you know, the law, the basket.  Why we call it as a basket is because that is the cart, what you take it usually.  So whenever someone places an order, what other things reside in their basket at time while they order.  Okay, and it could be at the same time or it could be multiple occasions or it could be different occasions within the same time period also.  Because you may be buying bread on like three days basis, but eggs you made by not daily or maybe milk you are buying daily, but it does not mean that you do not buy milk or bread.  So based upon that, you create your own baskets, you create out your own transaction there and then you analyze based upon that.  So how much money do you spend, how much products do you, how much products do you keep in your basket and what are the items you buy frequently or less frequently or you are reluctant to buy, but your facing challenges in there, whatever it is.  So then you can, we can put a probability based upon those, you know, the transaction.  So what we wanted is a support, lift and confidence about it.  So you will read lot more about it when you will go to your data science journey.  So we can, ideally we can put a probability of buying a certain product along with a set of products.  So that probability equation when we find out, we use it to suggest with the highest probability.  For example, someone likes to buy, someone is buying milk and eggs.  We will always suggest bread that because that is being one of the, or maybe tyke ones, that will be one of the common, most common items bought together and we will push it.  You know, even if the person has not bought it recently, but we know that people in the same vicinity might have bought it.  So we'll push it that if you buy it from here, and a person may be keeping this as subconsciously that I have to buy, type and I have to buy it later.  But as soon as they see it in the near to your message, they'll like, oh, I have to buy it also and they will edit.  So that is the power of pushing and recommendation.  And sometimes it's annoying, I don't.  But yeah, this is the way you bring more, or you do oxalo croc actually.  Then of course based upon the pushes and recommendations, your order history changes now because people who were not buying bread along with milk and eggs, now they have started buying it.  But my new basket says something else because these people were not part of my initial analysis or initial data set.  Now this year also part of it.  Now they will bring many more rules or many more, it's tied along with that and that we will analyze and we will rework upon the algorithm to give that a recommendation.  So that's how whole everything analysis works.  It goes multiple, you know, occurrences or multiple feedbacks.  But more and more and more and more if you look at probably top view, it works similar like this.  Another case study, it is the revenue growth management.  I think this is one of the highest paid case studies or one of the highest paid problems every company is facing.  How do I grow my revenue?  Most startups, they work mainly on the customers initially.  I think that how do I freeze my customer base, but once your stable revenue becomes more important because you have to sustain in the market.  So if you think that what we were discussing about right, what are the AGM elements?  So AGM elements would be your volume and revenue bet.  Do I need high volume and less profit or do I need high revenue, less profit, high, low volume and high profit.  Example to that is let's say Oreo versus Palerji.  I'm not sure if it's the right example or not, but if let's say one biscuit costs you some around 5 to B and one biscuit costs some around 50 rupees,  their volume of selling would be entirely different.  But the profit angle to that would be outstanding.  For example, for a 2 rupee product or let's say for a 5 rupee product, I may be earning 5 pesa, 10 pesa out of it in one packet as a company.  And for a 50 rupee biscuit, I may be earning 5 rupee or 10 rupees.  Now if I sell higher number of volume, I cannot sell because it's expensive, so I cannot sell higher volume.  But whatever I'm selling, I'm getting more money out of it.  So the mix of the balance between this volume and revenue will give you the right answer what you're trying to do.  Now of course you're pricing that are you keeping the right prices as I mentioned 5 rupees versus 50 rupees or should I keep you 10 rupees.  So most of you may be already knowing that but those who don't know about magic pricing in the FMCD.  So magic pricing is a term which everyone uses it that in India we do not like to carry change, carry each other or change.  I don't know what to keep 1 rupee, 3 rupee, 5 rupee, 10 rupee in my pocket.  I like to be whatever I go buy something, it should be like 5 rupee, 10 rupee, 15 rupee, 20, 25.  So let's say you go out and buy certain, let's say a bread and bread will cost you maybe let's say 42 rupees.  So you can give 15 rupee and they have to tender a change of 8 rupees.  So this 8 rupees will be your problem either you keep it with you, you cannot use it or they will give you maybe help me or something or if you are of course paying a UPI that's a different thing.  But your mentality still the same and either it is so as soon as it crosses 40 you will think as a 45 if it crosses 45 you will think as a 50 rupees.  So that magic price plays a very vital role in sense and you will see a cross beat your chips, beat your cold drink, beat your biscuits, they will all be in somewhere 5 rupee, 10, 15, 20, 25 rupees.  They sell them in biddles.  Then of course consumer and trade, shall I, as I was discussing that shall we use, right channel, should I sell it via distributor, via wholesaler, via supermarket.  So you would see that now more channels are being introduced.  One of the best examples is, if you see that whenever a new startup or any new company comes in they try to approach these people either through Google Pay, whenever you scratch and you find a coupon to some unknown product altogether.  They are not advertising it but they are sending it directly from there so that you go to their website and you get to know this is a product where you have lots of products and all these things.  The name is credit, credit will curate a collection for you based upon your profile and they will suggest a product to you.  So these are the new, initially it was supposed to be a supermarket, you go to supermarket and you get into a biscuit or a cold drink or maybe a credit section and you will find lot of products of your choice and you pick one and go ahead with that.  So now new channels, new ways of selling things are coming in and companies are exporting that.  When it comes to product placement, as I said the same thing that how am I placing my product?  Should I start or should I introduce a new product to a wrong market?  For example, I cannot sell a redwood or let's say I do not have 200 rupees beverage in maybe a removed or a village area.  They may be one or two customers but I cannot sell to the masses over there.  That's not a right market for me or I cannot sell an unbranded thing in a supermarket because people would prefer that I know I can relate to the brand, then only they will not provide.  So right for that right market is one of the things which comes into product placement and of course your immediate promotion is that how do you know, how do you get to know about that product.  So same thing about like a movie, right? So they do something you would know that okay this movie talks about symbols in a product that are you a newspaper person, are you a television person or are you a OTT person.  So depending upon that the promotions and media will play a vital role but that does not mean that every time I have to acquire a customer I have to shell out a lot of money.  And how do I retain sustainment for these things are part of my revenue generation.  Now one of the case studies which we were discussing about price elasticity which was like one of my I think my first project in a data science domain or this one.  So how does price increase impact of how does price increase happen in multiple places.  So you would know right so whenever anything price increases the first thing goes to my mind or your enemies might just let me not buy it with the same quantity.  Let me start buying little slow or little lower quantity.  Be it your unless it's petrol and gas of course but even if your petrol price is increasing you try to not do less traveling okay or try to less go on that.  Same goes with any other product whenever a company decides to increase the price they know they know the volume the sales will be dropping.  But what should be my ideal price increase so that my net revenue my net profit is something which I do not lose.  So that is explained in my in the right graph if you see that my price was changed from P to P one which got increased okay so that the delta P and my quantity is equal to P one.  And my quantity change from Q to Q one or other way round you want to be on to be.  So this delta my quantity always increase whenever my price increases.  So the delta will give you the ideal scenario based upon multiple analysis multiple statistics that what should be my pricing what should I how much price increase impact my quantity.  So the case studies are sorry the examples are at bottom so initially let's say I changed price from 10 to 12 which is 2 rupees delta my quantity reduced from 100 to 85 which is minus 15.  Now my revenue which was 1000 rupees earlier has changed to 20.  So my new increased delta revenues 20 rupees so I'm still gaining 20 rupees extra despite of decreased sales.  However if I did made a wrong choice I increased my price I became greedy and I increased my price from 13 instead of 12 I made it 13.  So the delta price is 3 rupees due to this my quantity the sales reduced to 75.  So my delta quantity is my next 25 of course now my revenue is new revenues 975 which is 25 rupees less than last time.  So if I would have kept it well or if I would have kept it 11 I would have gained money by increasing the price rather than losing it.  So this is the to how do I find this sweet spot whether to 12 or 13 that is the study is price elasticity and it happens on multiple angles based upon customer sentiment, service,  service always, completed prices, your medias all these things how do people consider product and one of the market of course on 10 to 13.  So based upon that these things or these passivity comes into my experience.  I think this concludes our data for now, sorry, for tech for now.  Sorry to have data.  So we can take questions and then I think Pooja would like to speak to you about, you know,  college too.  So I'll open the forum for the questions.  So Pooja please help me.  How do you know?  Yeah, yeah, how do everyone?  So if someone is having any doubts, so you can write in the Q&A box and Mr. Ayush will  be happy to answer all your questions or queries.  So, Tanvi is asking how to revenue with big management takes place.  How revenue with, I'm not sure whether, right, Tanvi would like to ask it again.  The question, what he asking?  He, she must type something.  Maybe he's asking about, she's asking on how revenue with big management takes place  like quality of products with high volume.  Okay, she's asking that how, in last slide, how case in case it was an example, Tanvi,  it was the resultant action that if someone did not do proper price elasticity example  and even in the high volume, they will never be able to take it.  So that does not matter high volume or what is the, you know, the actual number of volume.  It would be 20, it would be 20, it would be 20, me and also.  The impact of the delta will always be in terms of what I was selling earlier and what  I'm selling right now.  So that does not matter how much you are selling now, it depends how much you will sell after  your price change made at higher volume cycle.  Not sure if I answered your question, Tanvi, so we'll wait to ask again.  Yeah, anyone else, if someone is facing any cow, then he or she can write in the chat box.  Is it possible to unmute Tanvi, maybe that would make it easier for her?  Is it possible?  Actually, we didn't allow the viewers to speak.  So one question is asking from Vijaya, how is statistics useful in data analytics or  business analytics?  Sure, sure, sure.  So I would say it's one of the following stones actually for any analysis or analytics that  for example, I need to know what is my view on this, something about like average basket  size.  So to calculate that average basket size, there are multiple ways that people may be looking  at for every order, but what if the same person is doing multiple orders in the same day?  What if someone is looking at what is the average in recent three months, recent six months?  So statistics help you to derive the significance of the value of the calculation, what you're  trying to do.  So you would have heard about mean, median mode, what to use when the other term is called  inferential statistics, what you use before any of your analysis, before any of your hypothesis  when you start.  So statistics play very, you know, a very vital role when you arrive or when you're taking  any inference or maybe when you are assuming a particular quality quantity or even data  point.  So I was able to answer the question and either.  Yeah, so Vishwanath is asking like I want to win an internship.  So this is not an internship, this is a certification course which is affiliated with the analytics  of Adnights data science certificate data science certification course.  And anyone else want to ask something then we are happy to answer your questions.  I think no one is having any doubt.  No shoes, no shoes.  So if you do not have any questions, so we're going to do you want to walk them through  with the.  So we can walk them with the program details.  So can you please share the program details like.  So basically our program is affiliated with the analytics partner and these are the benefits  of choosing our program.  We have 200 plus learning hours and we have high performance one to one mentorship and  it's a coaching and life person is mentorship in the small pro groups and we have kept  some products projects also we have two tax from projects and K plus K studies.

You can fill out the form.  So keep these asking skills required for career in business analytics.  So I usually will be able to answer this question.  Sure, sure, sure.  Yeah.  Very good.  So keep asking what are the skills sets required for career in business analytics.  So keep the business analytics something if you I'll start with what actually business  analytics is that how do you understand the business in terms of what went wrong what  is going wrong and how can you improve it.  So if you you know restrict yourself until the first two part you know why and what is  going wrong then I think you need a great visualization expertise you know a little bit  of data transformation and bit of I would say you know RCAK case of things but I would  be I would stick to data transformation as well as visualization but if you go ahead  with little extra that you want"
